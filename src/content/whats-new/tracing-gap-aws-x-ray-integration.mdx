  <p>
    Whether you’re managing Amazon EC2 instances or writing AWS Lambda
    functions, AWS X-Ray is a critical distributed tracing tool for getting
    visibility across your AWS services, but it doesn’t automatically capture
    all calls outside of AWS.
  </p>
  <p>
    Conversely, New Relic Distributed Tracing provides automatic tracing for any
    application where the New Relic agent is installed—including on-prem and
    monolithic applications. One thing it lacked was visibility into trace and
    performance data from AWS-managed services where the agent couldn’t be
    installed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, you can combine New Relic Distributed Tracing and AWS X-Ray into a
    single, seamless experience. Automatically see an end-to-end view of
    requests as they travel through their applications, along with filtering,
    querying, and visualizing trace data to quickly debug issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    This update brings rich trace data for AWS-managed services so you can get
    insight into how services—like AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Queue Service,
    Amazon API Gateway, or Amazon DynamoDB—are contributing to your total
    transaction time or possibly causing errors.

    After you enable the X-Ray integration, AWS X-Ray trace data will
    automatically display in any distributed tracing view throughout New Relic
    One.
