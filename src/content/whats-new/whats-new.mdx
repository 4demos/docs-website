    Over the last month or two, we’ve made a lot of{' '}
    <a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/reimagined-new-relic-one-experience/">
      changes
    </a>
    . As we continue to build out new features and make iterations to New Relic
    One based on your feedback, we want to ensure you have an easy way to find
    all the information that you care about and need to navigate the platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    That is why we’ve created What’s New: your one-stop-shop to quickly learn
    more about every new change and feature. When there are updates to New Relic
    One, you will be notified and directed to What’s New for a closer look at
    what we’ve released. There, you will find posts for each feature with a
    brief description (of its utility), resources, tip-and-tricks, and best
    practices to ensure you are productively leveraging the newest innovations
    and getting the most out of New Relic One.
  </p>
  <p>
    The best part about having this wealth of information and tools at your
    fingertips is that you won’t ever have to leave New Relic One.
