    Dig deeper into alerts you receive with automatic alert analysis, which
    provides context and an explanation about each alert violation. You can also
    get a structured view and additional information about the entity and what
    was happening around it when the threshold was crossed to help you
    troubleshoot even faster. Alert analysis includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A chart of the violation</li>
    <li>Details about recent activity, the violation, and the entity</li>
    <li>A suggestion of key attributes that may explain the alert</li>
    <li>
      A comparison of signals showing associated anomalies (if you’ve configured
      Proactive Detection) and related signals for this specific entity, such as
      CPU, throughput, and more, that occurred around the same time as the alert
      violation
    </li>
  </ul>

    layout. In the upper left, you’ll see a chart of the alert violation. To get
    started, you’ll need to configure{' '}

    <a href="/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-applied-intelligence">
      Proactive Detection

    and Incident Intelligence, so if you want additional context—such as related
    anomalies—you’ll want to configure Proactive Detection.
