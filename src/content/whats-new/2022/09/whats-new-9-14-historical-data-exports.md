## Secure, store, share, and analyze your data using your preferred tools

If you’re on a [Data Plus](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new/2022/06/whats-new-6-1-data-plus-available) license, you can export your historical telemetry data outside of New Relic, giving you flexibility for deeper data exploration across related entities, events, and anomalies within your stack. Further, this allows you to use your preferred analytics tools across teams that don’t use New Relic at all. 

Exporting your data is accomplished by building queries in NerdGraph, returning up 200 million data points. The resulting data is provided as a downloadable link to a JSON file. For more on this feature, see the [historical data export docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-historical-data-export).
