  <p>
    New Relic can now ingest data from Amazon Web Services (AWS) Kinesis Data
    Firehose, making it easier than ever to gain visibility into your cloud
    stack. The Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service for delivering
    real-time streaming data to AWS services like Amazon Simple Storage Service
    (Amazon S3), Amazon Redshift, and a wide array of external destinations.

  <p>This integration brings a wide range of additional advantages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Fully managed: Amazon Kinesis is fully managed and runs your streaming
      applications without requiring you to manage any infrastructure.
    </li>
    <li>
      Scalability: Amazon Kinesis can handle any amount of streaming data and
      process data from hundreds of thousands of sources with very low
      latencies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Integrated with various AWS data sources: Amazon Kinesis can be used to
      easily collect Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Flow Logs, CloudWatch Logs,
      CloudWatch Events and AWS Internet of Things (IoT).
    </li>
    <li>
      Real time: Amazon Kinesis enables you to ingest, buffer, and process
      streaming data in real time, so you can derive insights in seconds or
      minutes instead of hours or days.
    </li>
    <li>
      Easily configurable: With the release of Kinesis Data Firehose HTTP
      endpoint delivery, you can easily configure data streams to automatically
      ingest and forward data to New Relic. You can also configure Kinesis Data
      Firehose to transform your data before delivering it. You donâ€™t need to
      write applications, manage resources, or create{' '}
      <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/lambda">AWS Lambda</a> functions, which
      makes it easier to manage and estimate costs for your data based on data
      volume.
    </li>
  </ul>
