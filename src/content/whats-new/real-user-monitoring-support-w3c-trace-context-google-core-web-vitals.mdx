    using{' '}

    , you can troubleshoot services instrumented with agents from other vendors
    without risking broken or incomplete traces. Additionally, this also ensures
    that you’ll be able to reliably traverse third-party components, including
    proxies and API gateways.

    Additionally, W3C trace context offers the same advantages when using open

    New Metric: Cumulative Layout Shift
  </h3>
  <p>
    We're excited to announce the release of{' '}
    <a href="https://web.dev/cls/">Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</a>, the third
    and final metric in{' '}
    <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/">Google Core Web Vitals</a>. This metric is
    an important user-centric metric for measuring visual stability, because it
    helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low
    CLS score helps ensure that your page is delightful and visually stable.
  </p>
  <p>
    The current set of 2020 Core Web Vitals focuses on three aspects of the user
    experience: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. These are the
    following metrics and their thresholds:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a
      good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page
      starts loading.
    </li>
    <li>
      First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user
      experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a
      good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For each of the above metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended
    target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th
    percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To
    learn more about the research and methodology behind these recommendations,
    see:{' '}
    <a href="https://web.dev/defining-core-web-vitals-thresholds/">
      Defining the Core Web Vitals metrics thresholds
    </a>
    . Tools that assess Core Web Vitals compliance should consider a page
    passing if it meets the recommended targets at the 75th percentile for all
    of these three metrics.
