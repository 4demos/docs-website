## Get feedback on your work in progress [#get-feedback]

Teammates can review your changes right in their IDE, with no need to switch
branches or set aside their own work. [Learn more about feedback
requests.](/docs/codestream/how-use-codestream/feedback-requests)

## Create or review a pull request [#pull-request]

Look for the Pull Requests section of the CodeStream sidebar to review an open
pull request. Just click on a pull request (or load one from URL) to get a
complete GitHub experience right in your IDE!
