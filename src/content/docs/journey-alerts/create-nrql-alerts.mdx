While using charts is a great way to create alerts from premade conditions, sometimes you need to create alerts from scratch. The process for creating a new alert from a NRQL query is almost the exact same as creating it from a chart: the key difference is that you write the NRQL query instead of using a pre-created query from a chart.

Creating alerts from NRQL queries requires a basic understand of NRQL, New Relic's Query Language. See our [NRQL docs](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/) to learn more about NRQL, including [how to use it](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-how-nrql-works/) and an [introductory tutorial](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-tutorial/).

## Create an alert

1. From **one.newrelic.com**, select [**Alerts & AI**](https://one.newrelic.com/alerts-ai), the [**Alert conditions (policies)**](https://one.newrelic.com/alerts-ai/alerts-classic/policies)

2. Select **New alert condition**

3. Write the NRQL query to create the alert. For example, if you wanted to to create an alert to monitor slow transactions, you can enter
```sql
SELECT average(duration) from Transaction facet name
```

4. Select **Next**
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Adjust the signal behavior

1. Set the data aggregation options. You will need to:
    * Use the **Window duration** setting to determine the interval grouping of your data, such as every 5 minutes or every hour
    * Choose whether or not you want to use sliding window aggregation. This feature creates smoother charts by creating overlapping windows of data
    * Choose the streaming method you want to use. **Event flow** is the default option. If you want to learn more about the individual settings to see which method should be used in each scenario, see [our docs](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/understand-technical-concepts/streaming-alerts-key-terms-concepts/#aggregation-methods)

2. Set the delay option for your alert. **Delay** determines how long New Relic waits for events in each aggregation window set in the previous set. Longer delays result in more accurate alerts, but will also make notifications take longer to send. 2 minutes is the default setting

3. Select the gap filling strategy for this alert. If you believe the data reporting will be sporadic, you can potentially avoid false alerts by filling in empty aggregation windows with data

4. Choose whether or not to use **Evaluation delay**. This option enables a custom period that New Relic waits to evaluate the signal against the alerting threshold you set
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Set the static thresholds

1. Set the conditions that will cause the alert to trigger. Start by selecting whether the alert will have a status of **Critical** or **Warning** in the **Security level** section

2. Set the value conditions that, when met, will trigger the alert. These values will change depending on what you want the alert to do. For example, if you wanted to create an alert for an error message, you might set the conditions to **equal to 1 at least once in 5 minutes**, but if you wanted to create an alert for longer periods of latency issues, you might set the conditions to **above or equal to 50 for at least 1 minute**

3. If you want to add another condition, select either **Add threshold** or **Add lost signal threshold**, depending on your needs

4. Select **Next**
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Add alert condition details

1. Add a name for your alert in the **Name** field. This will help you identify the specific alert, as well as find the alert in the future in case you need to edit or remove it

2. Choose the policy for this alert to apply to. If you have an **Existing policy**, select it from the drop-down. If not, you'll need to [create a policy](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/#alert-policy-name) by selecting **New policy** and creating it from here

3. Set any of the additional settings for the alert. This includes setting how long until open incidents are automatically closed and entering any custom descriptions for the alerts

4. Select **Save condition** to finish your alert
    </Step>
</Steps>

You've now created a NRQL alert! As you get more practice creating alerts and using NRQL to query your data, you'll find that creating alerts this way will often be faster than using charts, as you can simply write the query you need instead of needing to look for specific charts among your dashboards.
