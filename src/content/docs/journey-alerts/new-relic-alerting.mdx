Setting up alerts to notify you of issues with your stack is one of the most important things you can do for data observability. But creating and managing alerts often feels overwhelming. New Relic alerts give you access to powerful features while still being easy to set up and manage. In this tutorial series, you'll find guides on both of the main ways to set up alerts. You'll also learn how to manage alerts and notifications to reduce alert fatigue, as well as overviews on how to integrate some of our more advanced features, like anomaly detection and workflows.

Before you get started creating alerts, we have some basic alerting concepts and terminology, both for alerts in general and for specifically using alerts in the New Relic platform.

## What are alerts? [#alerts-what]

Alerts are conditions which, when met, will send you a notification to tell you about the triggering event. Notifications can be sent to one or multiple people across any number of teams. When properly configured, alerts enable you to more efficiently solve an issue when it arises by directly notifying the groups who are able to fix the problem.  There are three main parts to alerts:

**Chart**

* **Incidents** are events which trigger an alert. Common examples of incidents are when latency goes over a certain threshold, a page fails to load, or a JavaScript error occurs
* **Alerts** are policies that you set up to notify you when an incident happens
* **Notifications** are the messages that you receive when an alert is triggered

**Issues** and **Incidents** are often confused for one another. An **incident** is an individual event that triggers an alert, while an **issue** is a grouping of incidents that describe a larger problem in your system.

## Where are alerts in New Relic? [#alerts-where]

In New Relic, you most often manage your alerts from [**one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI**](https://one.newrelic.com/alerts-ai). This section of the platform has an **Overview** page that gives you visual breakdowns of all your alerts, as well as an **Alert conditions** page which gives you a list of all your alerts as well as a place to create new ones.

This doc series deals primarily with how to set up basic alerting to give you a solid foundation for getting started and learning exploring the aspects of alerting that are most relevant to your organization. For a full overview of all our alerting features, check out our [alerting docs](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/overview/).
