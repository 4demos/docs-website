As time goes on, your number of alerts will grow. This can lead to problems for your organization if they're not managed correctly. Additionally, your alerts will give you crucial information you can use to improve your system, and if you don't take advantage of that information, you won't be using your alerts to their fullest potential. Below, we've provided information on managing the quality of your alerts to prevent things like alert fatigue, as well as how you can use alerts to gather data and drive positive impact to your organization.

## Manage alert quality

Alert quality management (AQM) is a concept focused on reducing unneccessary alerts and helping you ensure the alerts you receive are the most relevant ones. AQM follows a simple flow of installing the dashboard, getting information to establish your baselines, gathering data over a period of time, and then making changes based on that data to improve your stack and drive positive impact for your organization.

To get started with AQM, you need to do the following:

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="AQM-dash"
        title="1. Install the AQM dashboard"
    >
1. [Go to the **Alert Quality Management** instant observability page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/alert-quality-management)
2. Click on **Install now**
3. Choose an account to install the dashboard into
4. View your dashboard
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="KPIs"
        title="2. Analyze your KPIs"
    >
With the dashboard installed, you can analyze key performance indicators, also known as KPIs. These KPIs are:

* Incident count (alerts with a high number of incidents)
* Accumulated incident time (alerts with high cumulative durations)
* Mean time to close (the amount of time it takes until incidents are closed)
* Percent under 5 minutes (the amount of incidents open for less than 5 minutes)

The **Alerting Count by Policy** pane in the dashboard helps you identify these alert policies and determine any relevant patterns.
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="first-enablement"
        title="3. Begin the first AQM orientation"
    >
The AQM dashboard gives you a baseline of KPIs that you can use to begin the improvement process. You and your teams can review the most active policies from the previous step to reduce alert noise. Ask yourself questions about what the data is telling you and how you can fix them, such as:
1. Are the alerts telling us something about a resource that needs to be fixed? If so, then fix the problem and see if the alert volume decreases.
2. Are the alerts telling us about something that actually requires an immediate response? If not, then adjust or disable the policy.
3. Are the policy thresholds set properly? If not, then consider adjusting the thresholds.

Your response teams should deal with the incident alerts following these guidelines during and after the AQM orientation:

* If you look at an alert and decide to take any sort of further investigative action, acknowledge the alert.
* If you typically close an alert without doing anything else, do not acknowledge the alert.
* If the incident alert is always on, do not close or acknowledge it. 
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="gather-data"
        title="4. Gather your data"
    >
It takes some time to accumulate your alert data from the dashboard. You should wait at least 2 weeks to gather this data, and regulary check to ensure that the incident responders for your alerts are following the guidelines outlined in the previous step.
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="second-enablement"
        title="5. Perform the second AQM orientation"
    >
After two weeks, you should have enough data to analyze and begin your alert improvement process. To improve your system using the alert data, follow the steps below:
1. Analyze the week-over-week trends in your KPIs. Find the areas that need to be fixed and you can begin finding ways to improve them.
2. Use the data to map the current state of alert quality, identifying areas where improvement has positively impacted the business and areas where problems have resulted in negative outcomes.
3. Use the dashboard to identify the noisiest incident policies. 
4. Review the policies identified in the previous step. For each policy, try to determine if the alert is relevant, properly configured, and what the alert tells you about problems that may need to be addressed.
5. Identify what areas you can work on to improve the policies you reviewed. This should be a technical analysis, and should end with recommendations in how to fix problems in your system that trigger the alert, how to tune policies that need improvement, or how to fix any gaps in your instrumentation

After completing the procedure above, you're well on your way to using your alerts to improve your system and provide a positive impact to your organiation. This is only the beginning though: there's a lot more to alert quality management than what we've covered here.
