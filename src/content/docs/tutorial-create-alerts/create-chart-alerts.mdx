Using a chart is one of the easiest ways to set up a New Relic alert. Instead of creating a NRQL query from scratch, chart alerts let you use pre-existing NRQL conditions to get your alert up and running. In this example, we'll set up an alert condition using an error response chart.

<Steps>
    <Step>
## Select a chart and define your signal

<img
    title="Defining a signal"
    alt="A screenshot detailing how to select a query for an alert condition"
    src={alertsSignal}
/>

1. From any **Dashboard**, select the chart you want to create the query from, then select **Create alert condition**

2. Select the signal you want to use to create the alert. To keep things simple, select the **Build a query** option for your first alert

3. Modify the NRQL query to match what you want you to monitor, if necessary. For now, we recommend leaving the query as is, but once you have a better handle on alerts and NRQL queries, you can change the query to monitor nearly any data threshold

4. Select **Next**
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Adjust the signal behavior

    src={alertsTune}
/>

1. Set the data aggregation options. You will need to:
    * Use the **Window duration** setting to determine the interval grouping of your data, such as every 5 minutes or every hour
    * Choose whether or not you want to use sliding window aggregation. This feature creates smoother charts by creating overlapping windows of data. This feature is disabled by default, and we recommend keeping it disabled for your first alert
    * Choose the streaming method you want to use. **Event flow** is the default option, and is the one we recommend for your first alert. If you want to learn more about the individual settings to see which method should be used in each scenario, see [our docs](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/understand-technical-concepts/streaming-alerts-key-terms-concepts/#aggregation-methods)

2. Set the delay option for your alert. **Delay** determines how long New Relic waits for events in each aggregation window set in the previous set. Longer delays result in more accurate alerts, but will also make notifications take longer to send. 2 minutes is the default setting, and the one we recommend for your first alert

3. Select the gap filling strategy for this alert. If you believe the data reporting will be sporadic, you can potentially avoid false alerts by filling in empty aggregation windows with data. For your first alert, select **None** under **Gap-filling strategy**

4. Choose whether or not to use **Evaluation delay**. This option enables a custom period that New Relic waits to evaluate the signal against the alerting threshold you set. It's useful for smoothing out the data, but for your first alert, you can leave it to the disabled toggle
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Set the static thresholds

<img
    title="Set static thresholds"
    alt="A screenshot displaying how to set static thresholds for an alert"
    src={alertsThresholds}
/>

1. Set the conditions that will cause the alert to trigger. Start by selecting whether the alert will have a status of **Critical** or **Warning** in the **Security level** section

2. Set the value conditions that, when met, will trigger the alert. These values will change depending on what you want the alert to do. For example, if you wanted to create an alert for an error message, you might set the conditions to **equal to 1 at least once in 5 minutes**, but if you wanted to create an alert for longer periods of latency issues, you might set the conditions to **above or equal to 50 for at least 1 minute**

3. If you want to add another condition, select either **Add threshold** or **Add lost signal threshold**, depending on your needs. For your first alert, just setting one threshold is all that's required

4. Select **Next**
    </Step>
    <Step>
## Add alert condition details

<img
    title="Alert condition details"
    alt="A screenshot displaying how to create the details for an alert"
    src={alertsDetails}
/>

1. Add a name for your alert in the **Name** field. This will help you identify the specific alert, as well as find the alert in the future in case you need to edit or remove it

2. Choose the policy for this alert to apply to. If you have an **Existing policy**, select it from the drop-down. If not, you'll need to [create a policy](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/#alert-policy-name) by selecting **New policy** and creating it from here

3. Set any of the additional settings for the alert. This includes setting how long until open incidents are automatically closed and entering any custom descriptions for the alerts

4. Select **Save condition** to finish your alert
    </Step>
</Steps>

You've now created an alert, and helped to make identifying issues with your system that much easier! While there are many options to select when creating an alert, the basic process when creating an alert from a chart will always follow the steps above. 

If that was your first alert, feel free to create more alerts from your charts with different options to get used to how they work. You can also create alerts from NRQL queries, which is the next topic in this tutorial series.

## Get more from alerting

We have some advanced alerting features that can help you make alerting more efficent and manageable for your team.

* If you want greater control over where and when you receive alerts and ensure the right people are notified about issues, see how to use [Workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).
* If you want to enable near-instant notification of critical alerts, helping you reduce your mean time to resolution (MTTR), see how to use our [anomaly detection with applied intelligence](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-applied-intelligence/).
* If you want to use APIs to manage New Relic alerts, we have [two options](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/alerts-api/intro-alerts-api/) you can use to do so.
