## What is MLOps? [#mlops]

MLOps stands for machine-learning operations. As more companies invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, there's a gap in understanding between the data science teams developing machine-learning models and the DevOps teams operating the applications that power those models.

MLOps provides a tool for monitoring and observing the performance and effectiveness of machine-learning models in a production environment. This increases the possibilities for collaboration between data science and DevOps teams, feeding into a continuous process of development, testing, and operational monitoring.

## What is Mona? [#mona]

Mona collects and analyzes data from models in production, allowing you to evaluate model quality with out-of-the-box metrics. With Mona you can detect data-drift or model-bias issues, and you can create actionable insights. Mona reduces the risk of data integrity and cloud or on-premise configuration, has user-driven metrics and alerts, and allows auto-benchmarking. 

Mona now offers an integration with New Relic: Add the state of your AI as monitored by Mona to your centralized operational view on New Relic.

## Migrate Data from Mona with New Relic [#integrate-mona] 

Mona allows you to automatically share processed contextual data with New Relic for later consumption in **[NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/)**. In order to receive data from Mona into New Relic, you need your account number and a special key, which you can obtain as follows:

1. **Log into your New Relic account:** Log into **[New Relic One](https://one.newrelic.com)** and click on **Explorer**. On the upper hand corner, on the main navigation menu, click on **+Add more data**.

2. **Select Mona:** Type **Mona** in the search bar, or scroll down to the MLOps Integration section and click on the **Mona** icon.  

3. **Copy your account ID:** Select the account ID you want Mona to integrate with.

4. **Select New Relic in the Mona portal:** Log into the Mona portal, go to the configurations page, and click on the relevant contextual class. Next, go to the **Integration tab**, and select **New Relic**. 

5. **Paste your account ID:** Paste the account ID you copied from New Relic in the account ID field.

6. **Select or create a processed API Key:** At the New Relic integration page, create a processed key (or select an existing API key) under **Processed Contextual Data**, and enter it in the **Processed key** field.

7. **Save the integration:** Click **Save** to have your data integrated in both Mona and New Relic. 

## Connect Mona insights to New Relic Incident Intelligence [#connect-insights]

New Relic’s **[Incident Intelligence](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence/#get-started)** helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events. By sending Mona insights to New Relic, you’ll be able to connect them to other issues from other sources, and get more clarity and understanding of your model.

1. **Add notifications in Mona:** Once you set up your integration in New Relic, go to the **Notifications** tab in Mona within your contexual project. Click **Add a notification** on the upper right hand corner, and proceed to fill in the relevant fields. 

2. **Get the User API Key:** Go back to the New Relic integrations page, and select or create a **User API Key** under **Active Insights**. Copy this key, go back to the Mona notification setup page, and paste the key under **New Relic Dashboards**.

3. **Get the REST API Key:** Similar to the step above, go back to the New Relic integrations page, and copy the **Auth token** under **Intelligent Incident Correlation**. Go back to the Mona notification setup page, and paste this key under the **REST API Security Token** field. 

4. **Save and get notified:** Click save at the bottom of the notification setup page. Now the next time Mona finds insights, you'll get a notification in Mona, an alert in New Relic, and you'll be able to view the insights directly in a dedicated [New Relic dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).

## View and explore your Mona models in New Relic dashboards [#view-explore]

Once you configure the New Relic integration in Mona, standard model metrics are sent to New Relic. See our model observability dashboards, and configure any specific model metric and incident policy for model observability tailored to your business context. 

1. **Go to the Mona integration dashboard:** Once you’ve setup your integration and insights, return to the New Relic integration page and click on **See your data**. This will redirect you to an automatically generated dashboard powered by Mona.

2. **Analyze Mona’s Dashboard:** ?

3. **Setup Alert Notifications:** Once you've created some dashboards, you can get alerted on your data. To create a NRQL [alert condition](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/) from a chart, click the chart widget **...** menu, then click **Create alert condition**. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy, or create a new one.

4. **Get notified:** Once you've created an alerts condition, you can choose how you want to be notified. See our docs on [how to set up notification channels](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts/).

5. **Correlate your incidents:** In addition to notifications, you can use Incident Intelligence to correlate your incidents. See our docs on [how to correlate incidents using decisions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/change-applied-intelligence-correlation-logic-decisions/).

You’ve now successfully integrated New Relic with Mona. Newly created Mona alerts are now correlated with your New Relic alerts, and you can see data about the most recent reported predictions.
