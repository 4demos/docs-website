## Problem [#problem]

You have executed your `docker run` command, but nothing seems to be happening and you see in the docker logs an error like `[Error] KTranslate Discovery SNMP Error: There was an error when writing the /snmp-base.yaml SNMP configuration file: chtimes /snmp-base.yaml: operation not permitted.`

This happens when the snmp-base.yaml file has an ownership permission that prevents the docker user from editing the file, most often this happens because you created the file as the `root` user or a similar privileged account.  The docker container runs with a non privileged user that cannot modify this file.  Inside the container ktranslate is always trying to use user ID 1000 and group ID 1000 so the ownership needs to allow for those ID's to own the file.

## Solutions [#solutions]

The most common way to resolve this issue is that from your privileged account you would need to change the ownership of the file before you can pass it into the docker container, for example you could run

`chown 1000:1000 snmp-base.yaml`
