metaDescription: You're collecting metrics from an SNMP device, but the data has inconsistent gaps.

## Problem [#problem]

You have a device that collects the expected data sometimes, but has inconsistent gaps in the charts.


## Solutions [#solutions]

This usually happens when a device is not able to reliably respond to the SNMP requests within the timeout period.  Common explanations for this would be if the network between the ktranslate container and the polled device is experiencing bandwidth contention, losing packets, or has high latency.  
Another scenario might be that the device is overloaded and cannot respond to the SNMP requests quickly, this usually happens when you try to collect OIDs from very large tables with a `poll_time_sec` that is too fast for the device to keep up with. 

As a general rule you want to locate your polling container as close to the monitored devices as you can in order to reduce the chance of a the UDP SNMP payloads not making the trip.

In cases where you must poll across WAN links with more latency you may need to edit the snmp-base.yaml file to increase the `timeout_ms` from the default 5000 ms to a longer interval.

If you believe you may have an unreliable connection to the remote site then you might consider increasing the `retries` from the default of 0.  Having a high number of retries but a timeout that is too short will likely not improve your situation and can potentially increase the loads on the monitored device as it is trying to respond to more requests and none of them get back before the timeout expires.

If you are polling large tables of data from devices, such as a busy load balancer, then it can take some additional time for the monitored device to gather the required data for the response. This can require setting a longer `timeout_ms` period and and setting a longer delay for `poll_time_sec`
