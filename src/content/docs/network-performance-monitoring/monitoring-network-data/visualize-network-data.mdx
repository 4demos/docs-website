After you've set up your network data for performance monitoring, you can go to New Relic One to install several custom curated visualizations designed specifically for network performance montoring.

Once you've set up these visualizations, you'll be able to start exploring the network data your devices are reporting to New Relic One.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

- Having set up your Network Performance Monitoring devices. Read how to:
  - [Set up SNMP data monitoring](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/snmp-performance-monitoring).
  - [Set up network flow data monitoring](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/network-flow-monitoring).
- Add the custom visualizations app to your account:
    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **Apps**, and search for **Network Agent Visualizations**.
    2. Click the app, and then click **Open visualization**.

2. Click **Quickstarts**, and in the search bar, search for **Network** and click one of the dashboards:
  - The **Network - Routers and Switches** dashboard for SNMP data.
  - The **Network - Flow Devices** dashboard for network flow data.
