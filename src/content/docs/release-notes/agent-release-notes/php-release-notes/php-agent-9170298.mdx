### End of life notices ###
* This will be the last release in which ZTS builds are supported. In the future, ZTS builds may not be provided and support may be completely pulled from the codebase.
* New Relic no longer supports PHP 5.3 or PHP 5.4. New Relic highly encourages upgrading to a supported version of PHP. If you would like to continue running the New Relic PHP agent with PHP 5.3 or 5.4, we recommend using version 9.16 of the agent, however please note that we can only offer limited support in this case.

### New features ###

### Bug fixes ###

* [A build up](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/pull/120) duplicate distributed tracing headers that sometimes occurs when using `file_get_contents` has been fixed.

### Support statement ###
