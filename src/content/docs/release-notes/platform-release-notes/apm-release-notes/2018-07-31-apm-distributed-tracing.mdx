### New

*   New Relicâ€™s distributed tracing feature gives you visibility into how requests travel across a modern distributed system.
*   It is available for APM Pro and equivalent subscriptions. It is currently available for these APM agents and agent versions:
    *   Java: 4.3.0 or higher
    *   Node.js: 4.7.0 or higher
    *   Python: 4.2.0.100 or higher
    *   Ruby: 5.3.0.346 or higher
*   Distributed tracing collect `Span` event types. These are queryable in Insights.

### Notes

*   Enabling distributed tracing results in changes to some APM features. Before enabling, it's recommended you read the [distributed tracing transition guide](/docs/transition-guide-distributed-tracing#rollout).
