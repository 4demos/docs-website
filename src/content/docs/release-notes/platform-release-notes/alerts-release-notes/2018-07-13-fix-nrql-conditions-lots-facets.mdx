### Bug fixes

*   UnknownGroup facet now ignored by condition evaluation
    *   NRQL conditions containing "facet" produce an "UnknownGroup" for all unique values produced beyond a 250 limit.
    *   This would cause false positives because the UnknownGroup (aggregate of all values beyond 250) was being evaluated against the condition threshold.
