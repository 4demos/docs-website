  <h3>New for Amazon Web Services monitoring</h3>
  <ul>
    {' '}
    <li>
      New Relic has optimized the way to fetch metrics from AWS Cloudwatch. This
      has resulted in a{' '}
      <strong>
        significant reduction in the number of calls to your AWS Cloudwatch
        service, as well as a reduction in data lag
      </strong>
      . The list of{' '}
      <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/getting-started/integrations-managed-policies">
        specific permissions
      </a>{' '}
      that are required to fetch monitoring data from AWS services has been
      updated accordingly, with the additional{' '}
      <code>cloudwatch:GetMetricData</code> permission.
      <br /> <b>Recommendation:</b> Use a custom policy only when you are unable
      to use the <code>ReadOnlyAccess</code>managed policy from AWS. If you use
      a custom policy, be sure to check that the new permission is included.
    </li>{' '}
    <li>
      <strong>AWS Redshift</strong> integration now provides{' '}
      <strong>four new metrics</strong> to monitor the performance of multi-node
      clusters: <code>QueriesCompletedPerSecond</code>,{' '}
      <code>WLMQueriesCompletedPerSecond</code>, <code>QueryDuration</code>, and{' '}
      <code>WLMQueryDuration</code>. Check{' '}

      for details.
    </li>{' '}
    <li>
      If you use <strong>AWS API Gateway</strong>, you can now fine-tune the
      data gathered for this service by specifying the stages you want to
      monitor with the new <strong>Filter by stage name prefixes</strong>. Check{' '}

      for details.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>New for Google Cloud Platform monitoring</h3>
  <ul>
    {' '}
    <li>
      <b>Google Kubernetes Engine</b> integration is now available. If you're
      using Kubernetes v1.10.2 or later, now you can get visibility into
      containers, nodes, and pods. This cloud integration is complementary to
      New Relic's{' '}
      <a href="/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration">
        Kubernetes on-host integration
      </a>
      .
    </li>{' '}
    <li>
      <b>
        You can now link your GCP projects to New Relic using a service account
      </b>
      . If you had already used a user account to link your projects, you can
      migrate to the new authorization type, though the UI. Check{' '}
      <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/getting-started/connect-google-cloud-platform-services-infrastructure">
        Connect Google Cloud Platform services to Infrastructure

      for details.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes in Google Cloud Platform integrations</h3>
  <ul>
    {' '}
    <li>
      The default dashboards for Google Cloud Platform integrations now include
      a <b>filter by Project ID</b>. This is very useful if you monitor more
      than one project from the same Google Stackdriver Monitor service.

  </ul>
