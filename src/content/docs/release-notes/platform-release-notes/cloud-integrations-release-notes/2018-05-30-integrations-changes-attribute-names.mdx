<div>
  <h3 id="tags">Tags and labels attribute renaming</h3>
  <p>
    In order to make it easier to find common attributes across different data
    providers in New Relic Infrastructure, tags and labels attribute names are
    going to be renamed as <code>label.&lt;name&gt;</code>, where{' '}
    <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    {' '}
    <li>
      The tag key&nbsp;for Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure integrations
    </li>{' '}
    <li>The label key for Google Cloud Platform integrations</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The previous attribute names will be deprecated on June 21, 2018.</p>
  <div className="callout-important">
    <p>
      If you are using tags or labels in alerts, custom dashboards, or saved
      queries for New Relic cloud integrations, be sure to rename them using the
      new format before June 21, 2018.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3 id="azure">Azure integrations: Resource group attribute renaming</h3>
  <p>
    To make it easier to find common attributes across different cloud services,
    the <code>resourceGroup</code> attribute will be replaced by the{' '}
    <code>resourceGroupName</code> attribute on June 21, 2018. This affects
    Infrastructure integrations for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    {' '}
    <li>Azure Virtual Machines</li> <li>Azure Service Bus</li>{' '}
    <li>Azure Virtual Networks</li>
  </ul>
  <div className="callout-important">
    <p>
      If you are using the <code>resourceGroup</code> attribute in alerts,
      custom dashboards, or saved queries for these Azure services, be sure to
      rename them using the new format before June 21, 2018.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3 id="aws-permissions">Amazon Web Services S3 permissions</h3>
  <p>
    The list of specific permissions that are required to fetch monitoring data
    from AWS S3 service has been updated with the additional{' '}
    <code>s3:GetMetricsConfiguration</code> permission in{' '}
    <a href="/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/getting-started/integrations-managed-policies">
      integrations and managed policies
    </a>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Recommendation:</b> Use a custom policy only when you are unable to use
    the <code>ReadOnlyAccess</code> managed policy from AWS. If you use a custom
    policy, be sure to check that the listed permissions are included.
  </p>
