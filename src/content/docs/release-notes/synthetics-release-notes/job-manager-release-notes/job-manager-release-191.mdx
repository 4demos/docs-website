* Added better logging around the error message: Encountered an Error finding synthetics runtimes: null
* Fixed an NPE error about the ping-runtime could not be found after all the runtimes have been downloaded successfully
* Replaced docker cpu quotas with docker cpu shares to ensure that unused capacity is not wasted
