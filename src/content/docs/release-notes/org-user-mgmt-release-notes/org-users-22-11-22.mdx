Some updates on recent changes. 

### Add and delete users via NerdGraph 

In November of 2022, we released the ability to add and delete users through NerdGraph. For more on that, see the [NerdGraph user management tutorial](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-manage-users). For a forum post about this, see [this Explorers Hub post on this feature](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/add-and-delete-users-via-nerdgraph/191462).
