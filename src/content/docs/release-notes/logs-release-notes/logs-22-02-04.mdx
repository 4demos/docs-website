### Logs are everywhere (no, really!)

When you're trying to troubleshoot a problem for your app or its related entities and services, who has time to search through thousands of logs? That's why logs in context of your apps and hosts help you quickly pinpoint the problem.

We've released several enhancements throughout New Relic One to make it easy for you to see your logs in context from anywhere in the UI! This includes:

* **See logs** link for a selected trace from APM's **Summary > Monitor > Distributed tracing** menu
* **See logs** link for a selected error from APM's **Summary > Events > Errors** menu
* Logs counts and errors for your app's related entities from the right panel on APM's **Summary** menu
* Log patterns for an app from APM's **Summary > Triage > Logs** menu
* **Logs** menu from the Explorer

By adding links to relevant logs directly in the context of your app's UI, you won't lose context of what you were tracking down. We're also providing summaries of log counts and totals, so that you can quickly see trends and decide whether you want to query deeper into the log data or switch over to the more detailed **Logs** UI.

In addition, if you have not installed logs in context for hosts related to your app, you can install our infrastructure monitoring's log forwarder capabilities directly from the app's **Summary > Triage > Logs** menu. From there, you can click on the popup menu to go directy to the guided install.
