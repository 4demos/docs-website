---

You control what customer data is logged with our log management service, so be sure to follow your organization's security guidelines to mask, obfuscate, or prevent sending any sensitive data.

Our log management service automatically masks number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see our [security documentation](/docs/logs/get-started/new-relics-log-management-security-privacy) for log management.

You can use NerdGraph at [api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) to create, query, and manage your data obfuscation rules for logs. NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API explorer.

## Parts of an obfuscation rule [#components]

The obfuscation rule is an enriched entity that allows you to apply different regexes to logs. It has three main components:

* **Filter:** NRQL query to filter the logs you want to obfuscate

* **Expressions:** The regex you want to apply; for example:

  ```
  name: email
  regex: [^@ \t\r\n]+@[^@ \t\r\n]+\.[^@ \t\r\n]+
  ```

* **Actions:** Which attribute to apply an expression and which obfuscation method to use

## Obfuscation API fields [#obfuscation-fields]

Available fields for your obfuscation rules include:

<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th style={{width: "200px"}}>
      Field
    </th>
    <th>
      Definition

  <tr>
    <td>
      `filter`
    </td>
    <td>
      * Expression: The entity that you want to apply the obfuscation rule to, such as an app, host, service, etc.
      * Rule: The NRQL filter that determines whether to apply the obfuscation actions to the log record
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>

    <td>
      The obfuscation rule's ID
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      `method`
    </td>
    <td>
      The obfuscation method used for the expression or rule; for example, `HASH_SHA256`
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      `name`
    </td>
    <td>
      Name of the obfuscation expression or rule (string)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      `regex`
    </td>
    <td>
      Regular expression for this obfuscation expression (string, 0-9). Capture groups are obscured on matching.
    </td>
  </tr>

      `updatedAt`
    </td>
    <td>
      Date and time the expression or rule was last updated

      `updatedBy`
    </td>
    <td>
      The user who last updated the expression or rule
    </td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Create obfuscation rule [#create-rule]

Before you can create an obfuscation rule, first create an obfuscation expression:

```
mutation{createObfuscationExpression( 
   			accountId:12345678, 
            expression: { 
            name: "SimpleNumericExpression", 
            description: "", 
            regex: "([0-9])" 
             })
            {id name description regex}}
```

You'll get a response like this example:

```
{
	"data": {
		"createObfuscationExpression": {
			"id": "161",
			"name": "SimpleNumericExpression",
			"description": null,
			"regex": "([0-9])"
		}
	}
}
```

Then, to create an obfuscation rule, follow this example format. Replace the following [fields](#obfuscation-fields) with your values.

* `accountId`
* `name`
* `description`
* `filter`
* `method`
* `expressionId`

```
mutation { createObfuscationRule(accountId: 12345678, rule: {
                   name: "Auth Service Obfuscation Rule",
                   description: "Hashes numbers from auth service logs",
                   filter: "serviceName='AuthService'"
                   enabled: true,
                   actions: [
                       {
                           attributes: ["message"]
                           method: HASH_SHA256,
                           expressionId: 166,
                       }
                   ]
               }) {
                   id,
                   name,
                   description,
                   filter,
                   createdBy,
                   updatedBy,
                   enabled,
                   actions {
                       id,
                       attributes,
                       method,
                       expression {
                           id,
                           name,
                           description,
                           regex,
                           createdBy,
                           updatedBy,
                       }
                   }
               }
            }
```
