---

You control what customer data is logged with our log management service, so be sure to follow your organization's security guidelines to mask, obfuscate, or prevent sending any sensitive data.

Our log management service automatically masks number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see our [security documentation](/docs/logs/get-started/new-relics-log-management-security-privacy) for log management.

You can use NerdGraph at [api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) to create, query, and manage your data obfuscation rules for logs. NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API explorer.

## Obfuscation fields [#obfuscation-fields]

**Reviewer:** Need fields and definitions here. Please include which fields are required and which are optional if applicable.

Available fields for your obfuscation rules include:

<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th style={{width: "200px"}}>
      Fields
    </th>
    <th>
      Description
    </th>
  </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>field</td>
    <td>Definition.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>field</td>
    <td>Definition.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>field</td>
    <td>Definition.</td>

## Example obfuscation rules query [#query-obfuscation-rules]

This NerdGraph API request example gets all of the obfuscation rules for logs in a given account. In this example, only a few fields are requested.

**Reviewer:** Need Query example here. Please include which fields are required and which are optional for queries, if applicable in the example. Also an example of what is returned if useful.

## Create obfuscation rule [#create-rule]

This example creates a new obfuscation rule for your log data.

**Reviewer:** Need Create example here. Please include which fields are required and which are optional for new rules. Also an example of what is returned if useful.

## Update obfuscation rule [#update-rule]

This example updates an obfuscation rule for your log data. 

**Reviewer:** Need Update example here. Please include which fields are required and which are optional for update. Also an example of what is returned if useful.

## Delete obfuscation rule [#delete-rule]

This example deletes an obfuscation rule for your log data.

**Reviewer:** Need Delete example here. Please include which fields are required and which are optional for update. Also an example of what is returned if useful. Are there any guidelines or cautions about what happens when you delete the rule? For example, if they were previously masking something their company requires, how long would it take before logs would start showing that data? Does the deletion take effect immediately?

## Anything else?

**Reviewer:** Anything else to say about this API? For example, the security doc says if they need to opt out of automatic obfuscation, they should contact New Relic Support. Will that still be true with this API?
