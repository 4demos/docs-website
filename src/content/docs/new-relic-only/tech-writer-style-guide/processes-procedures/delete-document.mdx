<Callout variant="caution">
  When you delete a document, its content and all redirects to it are completely and irreversibly deleted. If you believe the document may be of use in the future, OR if you do not want to re-create its redirects, consider another method to [hide the document](/docs/new-relic-only/advanced-style-guide/processes-procedures/hiding-content) from public view.
</Callout>

If you are certain you want to delete a document, do this:

1. Locate the doc you want to delete. 
2. Save the doc's content in a file and attach it to an associated Jira (in case we need the doc again).
3. PENDING: INFO ON REDIRECTS
4. Delete the doc and commit change.
