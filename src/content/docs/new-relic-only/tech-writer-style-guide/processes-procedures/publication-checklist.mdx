## Publication checklist [#checklist]

When publishing content, or reviewing the publication of release notes, check the following:

For overall content:

* Review for structural and appearance errors.
* Make sure the URL and any redirects are correct. See [Renaming and redirecting a document](/docs/new-relic-only/advanced-style-guide/processes-procedures/renaming-redirecting-document).

For new content:

* Review for grammar, spelling, and adherence to style guidelines.
* Make sure all new links are correct.

For new documents, make sure:

* The document is living in the right place, and in the right order with other docs. See [Renaming and redirecting a document](/docs/new-relic-only/advanced-style-guide/processes-procedures/renaming-redirecting-document).
* The metadata is correct.
