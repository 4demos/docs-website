We've covered the basics of NRQL in our other topics, such as what NRQL is, how NRQL works, and how NRQL relates to charts and dashboards. With this information, beginning to work with NRQL is the next step, and this tutorial is designed to help you do just that! Below we'll cover some foundational concepts within the language and get you set up with creating a some basic NRQL queries using your data. This tutorial teaches you how to:

* Use `SELECT` and `FROM`
* Use `LIMIT`
* Specify attributes
* Aggregate using average(), max(), min(), sum(), and count()
* Use SINCE and UNTIL
* Plot line graphs with TIMESERIES
* Filter using WHERE
* Group attributes using FACET

Want to learn NRQL within the New Relic platform? We've included a NRQL Lessons application on our [opensource.newrelic.com](https://opensource.newrelic.com/projects/newrelic/nr1-learn-nrql) site to help you quickly see NRQL's value and power within the application. To learn how to install and use the NRQL Lessons app, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 2:45 minutes).

Let's start by looking at a single event type in NRDB called **Transaction**, gathered by New Relic APM. Every NRQL query must have `SELECT` and `FROM` clauses: you must `SELECT` some data and tell us where it is `FROM`. Start with this simple query that selects everything from the **Transaction** event type.
 
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM Transaction
    ```

 This returns a lot of results. Each has a timestamp and a collection of attributes. For now, we only want a single result, so you can limit results to a single record using `LIMIT 1`.

 <Callout variant="important"> When a LIMIT is not supplied the default will be used, which is 100 table rows for SELECT * queries or 10 aggregated values for FACET queries and SELECT (attributes) queries. You can specify any limit up to the maximum. Use LIMIT MAX to return the maximum number of results possible.
</Callout>

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM Transaction
    LIMIT 1
    ```

/>
  </Side>
</SideBySide>

    We're now controlling the volume of results we get. But what if we don't want all the attributes? What if we would prefer to see only specific data points? Fortunately, like SQL, this can be done in only a few characters. We replace * with the name of the attribute(s) we want. In this case, we will ask for the name of a transaction and the duration of time it took.

    ```sql
    SELECT name, duration
    FROM Transaction
    ```

</SideBySide>
Now that you've made your first query, you're ready for the next step.
