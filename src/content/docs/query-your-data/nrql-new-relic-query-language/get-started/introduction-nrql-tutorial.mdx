We've covered the basics of NRQL in our other topics, such as what NRQL is, how NRQL works, and how NRQL relates to charts and dashboards. With this information, beginning to work with NRQL is the next step, and this tutorial is designed to help you do just that! Below we'll cover some foundational concepts within the language and get you set up with creating a some basic NRQL queries using your data. This tutorial teaches you how to:

* Use `SELECT` and `FROM`
* Use `LIMIT`
* Specify attributes
* Aggregate using average(), max(), min(), sum(), and count()
* Use SINCE and UNTIL
* Plot line graphs with TIMESERIES
* Filter using WHERE
* Group attributes using FACET

Want to learn NRQL within the New Relic platform? We've included a NRQL Lessons application on our [opensource.newrelic.com](https://opensource.newrelic.com/projects/newrelic/nr1-learn-nrql) site to help you quickly see NRQL's value and power within the application. To learn how to install and use the NRQL Lessons app, watch this short YouTube video (approx. 2:45 minutes).

Let's start by looking at a single event type in NRDB called **Transaction**, gathered by New Relic APM. Every NRQL query must have `SELECT` and `FROM` clauses: you must `SELECT` some data and tell us where it is `FROM`. Start with this simple query that selects everything from the **Transaction** event type.
 
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM Transaction
    ```
