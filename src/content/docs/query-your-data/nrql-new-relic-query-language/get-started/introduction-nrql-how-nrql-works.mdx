Before using any tool, it's best to understand how it works, and NRQL is no exception to that rule. We'll go over how NRQL works, and give you a foundation of not just creating queries using NRQL, but understanding how NRQL querying works as well.

## NRQL syntax [#syntax]

Many people are familiar with SQL queries, and if you are, you'll be happy to know that NRQL has a lot of similarities. If you're unfamiliar with SQL, we'll go over it now. Here's a quick breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query:

```sql
<a href="/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#state-select">SELECT</a> <a href="/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#functions">function(attribute)</a> [<a href="/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#sel-as">AS</a> 'label'][, ...] 
  <a href="/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#sel-from">FROM</a> data type
  [<a href="/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#sel-where">WHERE</a> attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...]
  [<a href="/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#sel-facet">FACET</a> attribute | function(attribute)]
  [<a href="/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#sel-limit">LIMIT</a> number]
  [<a href="/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#sel-since">SINCE</a> time]
  [<a href="/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#sel-until">UNTIL</a> time]
  [<a href="/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#sel-timezone">WITH TIMEZONE</a> timezone]
  [<a href="/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#sel-compare">COMPARE WITH</a> time]
  [<a href="/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#sel-timeseries">TIMESERIES</a> time]
```

All query languages have rules, and NRQL's basic rules are as follows:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        **NRQL condition**
      </th>

      <th>
        Details
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Required values
      </td>

      <td>
        The [`SELECT`](#state-select) statement and [`FROM`](#sel-from) clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either `SELECT` or `FROM`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Query string size
      </td>

      <td>
        The query string must be less than 4 KB.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Case sensitivity
      </td>

      <td>
        * The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive.
        * [NRQL clauses](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#clauses) and [functions](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#functions) are not case sensitive.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Syntax for strings
      </td>

      <td>
        NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example:

        ```sql
        ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57'
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Attribute names with spaces
      </td>

      <td>
        Use backticks ``` `` ``` to quote a [custom attribute](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-custom-attributes) name that has a space in it. For example:

        ```sql
        ... FACET `Logged-in user`
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Data type coercion
      </td>

      <td>
        We don't support data type "coercion." For more information, see [Data type conversion](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#type-conversion).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Use of math functions
      </td>

      <td>
        [Basic and advanced math functions](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/nrql-math-using-select) are supported in the [`SELECT`](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#state-select) statement.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Subqueries
      </td>

      <td>
        NRQL supports [subqueries](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/subqueries-in-nrql).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `JOIN` clauses
      </td>

      <td>
        NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL `JOIN` clause, but you can [simulate a `JOIN` with custom attributes](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/simulate-sql-join-functions-insights).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

These are the basic rules for NRQL, and we have information on [NRQL syntax and functions](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-components-functions) to help you build your queries.

## Data exploration [#explore-data]

One of the best ways to learn how to use NRQL is to access one of the [query tools](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language#where) and use it to explore your data. Let's take a quick look at an example of exploring your data using the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder). Here, we'll enter `FROM` into the query builder and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data, and we'll choose `Transaction` here.

<img
  title="nrql_query01.png"
  alt="A screenshot of a NRQL query beginning with From"
  src={queriesnrqlEventDefinitionsQueryBuilder}
/>

Next we will choose an [attribute](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute) using `SELECT`, and our query will look like this:

```sql
FROM Transaction SELECT
```

Press space and the interface will suggest available attributes. We'll choose `appId` for now.

<img
  title="nrql_query02.png"
  alt="A screenshot of a NRQL query using the previous screenshot and adding Select"
  src={queriesnrqlAttributeDefinitionsQueryBuilder}
/>

We now have a basic NRQL query, and running it will provide us a list of our APM transactions and the associated `appId` for each, as shown below.

<img
  title="basic_nrql_example.png"
  alt="A screenshot of a basic NRQL query, From Transaction Select appId"
  src={queriesNrqlBasicExample}
/>

<Callout variant="tip">
Don't be afraid to play with your data! You won't break anything using any of our query interfaces, so feel free to explore early and often!
</Callout>

Another great way to explore your data is to go into any existing dashboards you have, click **View query**, and run your chart in the query builder.
<img
  title="new-relic-view-chart-nrql-query.png"
  alt="New Relic view chart NRQL query"
  src={queriesnrqlViewQueryforChart}
/>

<figcaption>
  Charts built with NRQL will have **View query** as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization.
</figcaption>

## NRQL query examples [#examples]

Here's an example of a slightly more in-depth NRQL query of `Transaction` data, which is reported by [APM](/docs/apm). For this query we've chosen `Transaction` as our data type, used `Select` to determine our average duration, used `Facet` to group results by appName, and displayed the data over an automated timespan using `Timeseries`.


```sql
FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) 
  FACET appName TIMESERIES auto
```

This would generate a chart that looks like:

<img
  title="nrql_example.png"
  alt="nrql_example.png"
  src={queriesnrqlNrqlExampleTimeseries}
/>

Here are some more query examples:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="basic-browser-nrql"
    title="Basic NRQL query of browser data"
  >
    Here's a NRQL query of `PageView` data from [browser monitoring](/docs/browser).

    ```sql
    SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView 
      WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' 
      FACET countryCode
      SINCE 1 day ago 
      LIMIT 20
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="attribute-with-space"
    title="Attribute name with a space in it"
  >
    If a [custom attribute](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-custom-attributes) name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name:

    ```sql
    SELECT count(*)
     FROM Transaction
     FACET `Logged-in user`
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="query-multiple-events-columns"
    title="Querying multiple data sources"
  >
    To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all [APM transactions](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-attributes#transaction-defaults) and [browser events](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-attributes#browser-defaults) over the last three days:

    ```sql
    SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id=""
    title="Query returning multiple columns"
  >
    To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma:

    ```sql
    SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ...
      FROM ...
    ```

    This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring `PageView` events over the last week:

    ```sql
    SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration)
      FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
