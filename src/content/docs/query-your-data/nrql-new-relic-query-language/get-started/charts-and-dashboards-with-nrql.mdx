Knowing how to query your data is important for finding the information you need, but knowing how to visualize it is important for making that information understandable for you and for your organization. Charts and dashboards are the key to making this a reality, giving you numerous options that enable you to create data streams that are visually appealing and understandable at a glance. There are some key things to know about these features and how they relate to your NRQL queries, and understanding them helps you make the most of your data.

The last step of creating a NRQL query is to select the chart that you want to use to visually represent your data. There are numerous options available to help you find the perfect way to visualize your data, and there are many things you can do with a chart once you've made it. You can:

* Add your chart to a dashboard to monitor multiple data streams from a single location
* Share your chart with others by copying the permalink or downloading it as a PDF (or CSV, if applicable) file
* Edit the NRQL query behind the chart to help fine-tune the data you're seeing
* Create an alert condition from the chart to help proactively notify you when problems arise

Charts are great when they're on their own, but they really shine when you compile them together to create dashboards.

## Dashboards [#dashboards]

Where charts are great for reporting on individual facets of your data, dashboards are the best way to get a wider view of the picture: if charts are pieces of the puzzle, dashboards are the puzzle completed. Dashboards are highly configurable, and you can use them to show you as many or as few data streams as you want. You can:

* Add charts (using the query builder) or your own text, images, or links (using Markdown) to your dashboard
* Move charts around to make sure the most important data is where you want it to be
* Share your dashboard by email or create a permalink to your dashboard
* Import or export your dashboard as a JSON, or export your dashboard as a PDF
* Duplicate the dashboard to use as a foundation for an entirely new one
* Edit your dashboard components to add new data streams, modify existing ones, or remove older ones that are no longer relevant
