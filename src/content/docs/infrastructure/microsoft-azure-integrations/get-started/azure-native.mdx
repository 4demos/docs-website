If your team deploys software and cloud services through Azure, our Azure Native New Relic Service lets you deploy and manage New Relic directly through the Azure Marketplace.  

- Create a free New Relic account or purchase New Relic directly from your Azure Portal
- Manage billing directly through Azure Marketplace
- Deploy APM and infrastructure agents through an automated setup flow 
- Manage the metrics and logs for all your resources through an interactive dashboard

## What you can monitor

You can deploy the following agents through the Azure Native New Relic service:

APM agents:
* .NET
* Java

Infrastructure agents: 
* Windows
* Linux 

## Create a New Relic resource in Azure Portal

1. In the Azure Marketplace, subscribe to the Azure Native New Relic Service.
2. In your Azure Portal, create a New Relic resource.
3. Select **Create a New Relic resource** to create a new New Relic account to monitor your Azure data or **Link an existing New Relic resource** to link your Azure data to an existing New Relic account.
4. Complete the prompt that appears and select **Review + create**.
5. Configure how your service reports metrics and logs in the **Resource configuration** tab.
6. Verify that New Relic is receiving data in the **Monitored resources** tab of the Azure Portal. Resources with a green checkmark are sending data to New Relic.

## View your data in New Relic

Once you've created your New Relic resource and verified that Azure is sending data to it, you can go into New Relic. 

To log into New Relic: 

1. On the **Overview** page for the new resource, click **Login to New Relic account**. 
2. You'll need to create a new password. To do this, click **Forgot your password**. 
3. Enter your email address. It must be the same one you use for your Azure account. 

Once you're in New Relic, here are some tips on what to look at first: 

1. [View your APM data](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/apm-summary-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data)
2. [View your infrastrucuture data](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-ui-entities)
3. [View and analyze your logs](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui/)
4. [Set up alerting](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/your-first-nrql-condition)

### Note about datacenters 

The Azure Native New Relic Service stores your data directly on Microsoft's Azure data centers. Currently the Azure Native service stores all data in Azure's US East region. 

New Relic's log patterns service operates solely in Amazon Web Services. By using New Relic log patterns, you agree that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in Amazon Web Services. This applies whether you store your data in New Relic's Azure data center or in our Amazon Web Services data center.
