title: Introduction to the Azure Native New Relic Service
---

The Azure Native New Relic Service in the Azure Marketplace enables you to create and manage New Relic accounts using the Azure portal with a seamlessly integrated experience. This enables you to use New Relic as a monitoring solution for your Azure workloads through a streamlined workflow, starting from procurement, all the way to configuration and management.

To begin using the Azure  Native New Relic Service, you must first create a New relic resource within Azure and then configure your service to monitor metrics and logs.

## Prerequisites

- An azure account subscribed to the Azure Native New Relic Service // Link to MS docs
- A New Relic account (optional)

## Create a New Relic resource 

1. Create a New Relic resource by clicking the button // Find final UI path within Azure
2. Select **Create a New Relic resource** if you want to create a new New Relic account to monitor your azure data or **Link an existing New Relic resource** if you want to link your azure data to an existing New Relic account.
3. Complete the following prompt and select **Review + create**

## Configure metrics and logs

In the resource configuration pane, you can configure how your service reports metrics and logs. See Microsoft's docs on how to configure these [link to doc]. 

You can verify that Azure Native is sending data to New Relic in the **Monitored resources** tab of the Azure Portal. Here you can see all your resources and their status in reporting metrics and logs.

Various ways we can take this area, and it isn't that technical. Let's focus in on brainstorming what key workflows we want azure users to focus on that deliver the most value for their specific cases. Link out to NR docs here, but be generous in our onboarding.
