title: Introduction to the Azure Native New Relic Service
---

The Azure Native New Relic Service in the Azure Marketplace enables you to create and manage New Relic accounts using the Azure portal with a seamlessly integrated experience. This enables you to use New Relic as a monitoring solution for your Azure workloads through a streamlined workflow, starting from procurement, all the way to configuration and management.

To begin using the Azure  Native New Relic Service, you must first create a New relic resource within Azure and then configure your service to monitor metrics and logs.

## Prerequisites

- An azure account subscribed to the Azure Native New Relic Service // Link to MS docs
- A New Relic account (optional)

## Create a New Relic resource 

1. Create a New Relic resource by clicking the button // Find final UI path within Azure
2. Select **Create a New Relic resource** if you want to create a new New Relic account to monitor your azure data or **Link an existing New Relic resource** if you want to link your azure data to an existing New Relic account.
3. Complete the following prompt and select **Review + create**

## Configure metrics and logs

In the resource configuration pane, you can configure how your service reports metrics and logs. See Microsoft's docs on how to configure these [link to doc]. 

You can verify that Azure Native is sending data to New Relic in the **Monitored resources** tab of the Azure Portal. Here you can see all your resources and their status in reporting metrics and logs.
