We have several ways for you to monitor your [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) applications and services: 

* New Relic in Azure: With our [Azure Native New Relic Service](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/azure-native), you can easily deploy New Relic directly from the Azure Marketplace. 
* Our Azure integrations: Our [Azure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/activate-azure-integrations) report telemetry data from dozens of Azure services. 
* .NET APM: You can install [our .NET APM agent](/install/dotnet) to monitor your Azure application and received detailed telemetry data.
