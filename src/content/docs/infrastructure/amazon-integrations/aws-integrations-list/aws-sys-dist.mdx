Install New Relic's infrastructure agent on your AWS EC2 Instances in a single click through our integration for [AWS System Manager Distributor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/distributor.html). This document explains the integrations features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features
Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from diverse AWS instances through a single click. New Relic's AWS System Manager Distributor integration installs our infrastrucutre agent on your AWS instances to allow you to quickly monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance. 

## Pre-Requisites

Complete the setup recommended by AWS at [AWS Systems Manager documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up.html) to configure roles, user accounts, permissions, and initial resources required for your EC2 instances to be communicating with AWS Systems Manager.

## Activate integration

You can use the AWS Systems Manager console to install or update **New-Relic-infrastructure-monitoring-agent** distributor package one time or on a schedule\. 
When you configure a one\-time installation, Distributor uses [AWS Systems Manager Run Command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/run-command.html), a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to perform the installation\.
When you schedule package installation or update, Distributor uses [AWS Systems Manager State Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-state.html) to install or update\.

**To install or update the agent**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.
In the navigation pane, choose **Distributor** ,  select **Third party** and select the **New-Relic-infrastructure-monitoring-agent** tile

2. Select the installation mode. You can install or update the **New-Relic-infrastructure-monitoring-agent** package one time or schedule the installation. For detailed information on installing the Distributor packages, see [AWS Systems Manager Distributor documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/distributor-working-with-packages-deploy.html).

3. For **Action**, choose **Install**\.
4. For **Installation type**, choose one of the following: 
   + **Uninstall and reinstall**: The package is completely uninstalled, and then reinstalled\. New Relic agent is unavailable until the reinstallation is complete\.
   + **In\-place update**: The application remains available throughout the update process\. 

5. For **Additional Arguments**, paste the following. Replace **YOUR_NEWRELIC_LICENSE_KEY** with your [New Relic API Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/). 

```
{
  "SSM_NR_LICENSE_KEY" : "YOUR_NEWRELIC_LICENSE_KEY"
}

```

6. In the **Targets** section, choose the managed nodes on which you want to run this operation by specifying tags, selecting instances or devices manually, or by specifying a resource group\.
If you don't see a managed node in the list, see [Troubleshooting managed node availability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/troubleshooting-managed-instances.html)\.

7. For **Rate Control**:
   + For **Concurrency**, specify either a number or a percentage of targets on which to run the command at the same time\.

**Note**  
If you selected targets by specifying tags or resource groups and you aren't certain how many managed nodes are targeted, then restrict the number of targets that can run the document at the same time by specifying a percentage\.
   + For **Error threshold**, specify when to stop running the command on other targets after it fails on either a number or a percentage of managed nodes\. For example, if you specify three errors, then Systems Manager stops sending the command when the fourth error is received\. Managed nodes still processing the command might also send errors\. 

8. **Verify the installation**. After you run the installation, check the progress in the Command status area. When you see the Success status it means the installation was successful.
9. Explore your app's data in the [our UI](one.newrelic.com).


## Configuration and polling 

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling information](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) for the AWS integrations:
- New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
- Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute or 5 minutes


## Find and use data

After you installed the New Relic infrastructure agent, [you can adjust and tune the data flow coming from your instances.](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-monitoring/get-started/get-started-infrastructure-monitoring/)
