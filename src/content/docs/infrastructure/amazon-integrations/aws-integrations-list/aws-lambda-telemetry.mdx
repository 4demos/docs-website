 # New Relic AWS Lambda Telemetry extension

The New Relic AWS Lambda Telemetry extension allows users to send telemetry data straight from their lambda functions into New Relic, with no need to set up triggers or connect Amazon CloudWatch. Send your logs, events, metrics and traces by simply adding the extension as the layer and inputting your New Relic license key.

## Installation

1. In the AWS Console go to **Lambda** > **Functions** then choose the function you'd like to ingest data from.
2. Select **Layers** > **Add Layer**.
3. In **Choose a layer** select the **Specify a layer by providing the ARN** option.
4. Put `arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:533243300146:layer:python-telemetry-api-extension:<version>` in the field, then click **Add**.
5. Go to **configuration**, select **Environment variables** and add **Key: LICENSE_KEY  Value: <var>LICENSE_KEY</var>**. 

To verify that set up has been done correctly, click the **Test** button in **code** section. 

## Find your data

After the test has completed, you can find your data on New Relic by navigating to **[https://one.newrelic.com/](https://one.newrelic.com/)** > **Browse data** > then selecting one of 4 categories: **Logs, Events, Metrics or Traces**.

### Logs:

Logs can be filtered by specific attributes set. Click **Attributes** in left menu and then choose the attributes of interest. For example:

```
SOURCE > api.logs
PLUGIN > TYPE > lambda extension
AWS > EXTENSION > python-telemetry-api-extension
```

### Metrics:

Metrics sent by the extension are prefixed with `aws.telemetry.lambda_ext.`. Currently there are 6 AWS lambda metrics:

```
'durationMs'
'billedDurationMs'
'initDurationMs'
'memorySizeMB'
'maxMemoryUsedMB'
'producedBytes'
```

### Events

To see event sent by this extension, in **Custom events** section look for `Lambda_Ext_` prefix. Currently there are
twelve event types:

```
platform_initStart
platform_initRuntimeDone
platform_initReport
platform_start
platform_runtimeDone
platform_fault
platform_report
platform_extension
platform_telemetrySubscription
platform_logsDropped
function
extension
```

### Traces
