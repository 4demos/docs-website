With the help of New Relic's Dojo dashboard, you can track your application's core web vitals, user time on the site, and browser performance metrics like Initial page load, route change, throughput and page views with Javascript errors. By using our browser monitoring agent, the Dojo dashboard lets you view all your most important data in one place.

## Install the infrastructure agent (optional) [#infra-install]

Before getting Dojo data into New Relic, you may first want to install our infrastructure agent. You can do this by following our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=999174fa-ed8b-d707-af7b-8e4f8fd03cc1) or installing the infrastructure agent by [following the docs](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent). It's a good idea to do this because the infrastructure agent provides additional layers of monitoring, but is not necessary in order to allow the browser agent to work with Dojo.

## Install the browser agent [#browser-install]

1. Install our browser agent by going to our [install launcher](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=3510613&state=79352429-fa28-4c25-1123-30c4b23ff83c) and clicking **Browser monitoring**.
2. Select your account and follow the instructions in the UI.
2. Install the pre-built Dojo dashboard on the [Dojo instant observability page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/dojo)

## What's next?

With the browser agent installed and instrumented with your app, you can then view your raw data in [Metrics & events](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer/). The default dashboards transform the raw data into charts and graphs that provide a high level view of your system's health. To install our default dashboards, go to our [instant observability page]()
