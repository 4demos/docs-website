## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

Installing our infrastructure agent is the first step to getting your app data into New Relic. Our infrastructure agent collects and ingests data from your app so you can keep track of your app’s performance. To learn more about the infrastructure agent, check out [DOC]().

You can install the infrastructure agent a few different ways. 

* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=4f81feab-35f7-e97e-9903-52510f8542bd) is a CLI tool that inspects your system and installs both the infrastructure agent and the best application monitoring agent for your system. To learn more about how our guided install works, check out our [overview doc](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/new-relic-guided-install-overview). 
* If you’d rather install our infrastructure agent manually, you can follow a tutorial for manual installation for [Linux](), [Windows](), or [iOS](). 

## Export Nextcloud data [#export]

Our Nextcloud dashboards display your Nextcloud metrics about your user accounts, database size, and file health. Our integration uses `nextcloud-exporter` on top of our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, which is installed by running a Docker image. 

It is currently provided on Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry:
Run the below docker commands : 
docker pull ghcr.io/xperimental/nextcloud-exporter:latest
docker pull xperimental/nextcloud-exporter:latest
Install Go language before moving to the next step.

Clone Nextcloud-exporter:
git clone https://github.com/xperimental/nextcloud-exporter.git
cd nextcloud-exporter

Create a binary using make
make

A binary file named ‘nextcloud-exporter’ should be created inside nextcloud-exporter folder
cd nextcloud-exporter

Token authentication (Make sure nextcloud version should be 22 or more)
# Generate random value (for example using openssl)
TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
# Set token (using the occ console application), go inside path: “/var/www/nextcloud” to use occ command
occ config:app:set serverinfo token --value "$TOKEN"

In the cloned folder, you will find the nextcloud-exporter binary. Follow the below command to start nextcloud using Username and Password authentication
./nextcloud-exporter --login <USERNAME> <PASSWORD> --server http://127.0.0.1


To access metrics for nextcloud, run the following command:
./nextcloud-exporter -u <YOUR_USERNAME> -p <YOUR_PASSWORD> --server http://127.0.0.1:9205

On browser, run the following url : “http:127.0.0.1:9205/metrics”

## Get Snowflake metrics in a dashboard [#dash]

Once you've installed the [Snowflake quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/snowflake), you can see your critical Snowflake data in New Relic. 

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, then click **Metrics & events**.
2. Run either NRQL queries to view your Snowflake metrics: `SELECT * FROM SnowflakeAccount` or `SELECT * FROM SnowflakeVirtualWarehouse`.
3. Once you've confirmed that New Relic ingested your Snowflake metrics, go to **Dashboards** from **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)** to see your Snowflake dashboards. 

## What's next?

To learn more about building NRQL queries and generating dashboards, check out these docs:

* [Introduction to the query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder) to create basic and advanced queries.
* [Introduction to dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) to customize your dashboard and carry out different actions.
* [Manage your dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard) to adjust your dashboards display mode, or to add more content to your dashboard.
