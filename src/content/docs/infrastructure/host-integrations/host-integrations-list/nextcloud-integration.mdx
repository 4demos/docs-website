With our Nextcloud dashboard, you can easily track the number of files in your system, your user accounts, and your database size. Built with our infrastructure agent and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, the Nextcloud integration gives you a set of default <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> that let you view your most critical data all in one place.

After setting up the Nextcloud integration with New Relic, your data displays in dashboards like these right out of the box.

**Prerequisites**

To get your Nextcloud data in New Relic, you need to:

* [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) and make (if required).
* Use Nextcloud 22 or later.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

To get data into New Relic, install our infrastructure agent. Our infrastructure agent collects and ingests data so you can keep track of your app’s performance.

You can install the infrastructure agent two different ways: 

* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=4f81feab-35f7-e97e-9903-52510f8542bd) is a CLI tool that inspects your system and installs the infrastructure agent alongside the application monitoring agent that best works for your system. To learn more about how our guided install works, check out our [Guided install overview](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/new-relic-guided-install-overview). 
* If you’d rather install our infrastructure agent manually, you can follow a tutorial for manual installation for [Linux](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux), [Windows](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-windows/), or [macOS](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/macos-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-macos/). 

## Export Nextcloud data [#export]

To start the integration process, you need to export your Nextcloud metrics with `nextcloud-exporter`. This eventually allows our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration to ingest data into New Relic. After you've exposed your metrics, you need to complete token authentication.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="export"
    title="Export your Nextcloud data"
  >
1. Run the following Docker commands to access `nextcloud-exporter`:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/xperimental/nextcloud-exporter:latest
docker pull xperimental/nextcloud-exporter:latest
```

2. Clone `nextcloud-exporter`:

```
git clone https://github.com/xperimental/nextcloud-exporter.git
```

3. Create a binary file in the `nextcloud-exporter` folder named `nextcloud-exporter` using `make`.
```
make
```
A binary file named `nextcloud-exporter` should be created inside the nextcloud-exporter folder.

</Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="token"
    title="Complete token authentication"
  >

1. To authenticate your token, you need to login to Nextcloud and follow the below steps:

    1. Go to `Personal Setting` and click on `Security` from the left side menu bar.
    2. Find `Devices & Sessions` , enter app name and click on `Create New App Password`.
    3. Copy the TOKEN to use it in nextcloud-exporter configuration (occ command will execute with this token).
    4. Set the token using the occ command by going to path of Nextcloud :
    
  <Callout variant="tip">
    Nextcloud path can vary based on your Nextcloud setup.
  </Callout>
    
  ```
  /var/www/html/nextcloud
  ```
  ```
  sudo -u www-data php /var/www/html/nextcloud/occ config:app:set serverinfo token --value "<TOKEN>"
  ```

2. From your cloned nextcloud-exporter folder, run the following command to initiate username and password authentication:

  ```
  ./nextcloud-exporter --login <USERNAME> <PASSWORD> --server http://127.0.0.1/nextcloud
  ```

  Copy output url, run on browser and you’ll find page like attached screenshot:
    
  <img width="1029" alt="connectAccount" src="https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/assets/101187392/39f7e1c8-9224-4437-a468-2b5b2045da9b">
    

  Click on ‘Log in’, grant access and get the message `Account connected`. Now you’ll receive a username with an encrypted password on the terminal.

    
3. To access metrics for Nextcloud, run the following command from your cloned nextcloud-exporter folder:
    
  <Callout variant="tip">
    Use password which is shown as output after step 6.
  </Callout>
    
  ```
  ./nextcloud-exporter -u <YOUR_USERNAME> -p <ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD> --server http://127.0.0.1/nextcloud
  ```

4. From your browser, go to `http:127.0.0.1:9205/metrics` to view your metrics.

## Integrate Prometheus OpenMetrics with Nextcloud [#prometheus]

With the infrastructure agent installed, you need to establish a line of communication between Nextcloud and New Relic with our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Prometheus OpenMetrics scrapes your exposed Nextcloud data so they appear in our prebuilt dashboards.

1. Follow our instructions to install our [Prometheus OpenMetrics integration](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-openmetrics/install-update-or-uninstall-your-prometheus-openmetrics-integration). 
2. Create a file named `nri-prometheus.config.yml` on the below path.
    
 ```
 /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
 ```
3. Update the `nri-prometheus.config.yml` file to match our snippet in the [`nri-prometheus` repository](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-prometheus/blob/main/configs/nri-prometheus-config.yml.sample).
3. To get server-related information, replace the URL inside the targets. The replacement URL should match the URL associated with your exposed Nextcloud metrics:

 ```
 targets:
   urls: ["http://127.0.0.1:9205"]
 ```
    
5. Follow our doc to [restart your New Relic infrastructure service](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent).
6. Install the [Nextcloud quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/nextcloud) to get your pre-built dashboards.
    
    
## Query your data using NRQL
You can use this sample query to view your Lighttpd metrics captured on [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities):

Here's an example of NRQL query checking the number of active users for the last 5 minutes.
```
SELECT latest(nextcloud_active_users_total) FROM Metric
```

Here's an example of NRQL query checking the number of active users in the last 24 hours.
```
SELECT latest(nextcloud_active_users_daily_total) FROM Metric
```

## What's next?

To learn more about building NRQL queries and generating dashboards, check out these docs:

* [Introduction to the query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder) to create basic and advanced queries.
* [Introduction to dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) to customize your dashboard and carry out different actions.
* [Manage your dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard) to adjust your <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> display mode, or to add more content to your dashboard. 
    
## Troubleshoot your issues:
    
Every time you open a page in Nextcloud you are greeted with the message:
`Invalid private key for encryption app. Please update your private key password in your personal settings to recover access to your encrypted files.`
    
![nextcloud_bug](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/assets/101187392/26f01099-ab31-490d-91d2-7ea8e616f473)

Solution:
    
Check the status of Nextcloud encryption:
```
sudo -u www-data php /var/www/html/occ encryption:status
```
    
If you see “enabled: false”, enable the encryption:
```
sudo -u www-data php /var/www/html/occ encryption:enable
```
    
Verify that “enabled: true” has taken place:
```
sudo -u www-data php /var/www/html/occ encryption:status
```
    
Now you can exit the Nextcloud and refresh your Nextcloud browser session. You are free to enjoy your Nextcloud without the annoying greeting.
