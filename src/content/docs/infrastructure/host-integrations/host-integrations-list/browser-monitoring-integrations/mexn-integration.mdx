MEAN and MERN stacks are open-source full stack software development kits. Both kits use a single codebase to develop web applications. New Relic has combined both stacks into a single quickstart. Our MExN integration makes use of the Browser agent, Node,js agent, and MongoDB agent to provide you with a pre-built dashboard with your most important metrics (like response time, cpu utilization, traffic and login frequencies).

After setting up our MExN integration, we give you a dashboard for your MExN web app metrics.

## Install [#install]

### Step 1 (optional): Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

Installing the infrastructure agent is optional, but doing this will get you important metrics about the host where your app is running. 

To do this, follow [the infrastructure agent install steps](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent).

### Step 2: Install MongoDB quickstart

1. Check out our MongoDB agent requirements in our [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/mongodb-monitoring-integration/)  before installing the agent.
2. Open [MongoDB quickstart installation](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/mongodb). 
3. Click  **install now** at the bottom of the page to start the MongoDB agent installation.

### Step 3: Install Node.js agent

1. Check out our Node.js agent requirements in our [documentation](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent/).
2. Open [Node.js quickstart installation](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/node-js). 
3. Click  **install now** at the bottom of the page to start the Node.js agent installation.

### Step 4: Install the browser agent [#browser-install] 

To install our browser agent: 

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the [**Add data** page](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace). 
2. Click **Browser and mobile**, then click **Browser monitoring**.
3. Select the **Select copy/paste JavaScript code** option (for more about this code, see [our browser install docs](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent)). 
4. Complete the rest of the steps and click **Enable.**
5. Go the `index.html ` file of your React application
6.  Paste our browser code snippet script tag right before the body tag ends (`</body>`).
8. Restart your application. 

Wait five minutes and then proceed to finding your data in New Relic. 

## Find your data [#find-data]

To get your MExN dashboard: 

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the [**Add data** page](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace). 
2. Click on **Dashboards**.
3. In the search bar, type `MExN`. 
4. The MExN dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

Your MExN dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the **Dashboards** UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

This integration reports data in the form of our [browser monitoring events](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/event-data/events-reported-browser-monitoring). If you installed the infrastructure agent, you'll also receive [infrastructure data](/docs/infrastructure/manage-your-data/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-monitoring-data/#infrastructure-events). 

Here's an example NRQL query checking the average window load time for the various browsers used by users on desktop computers: 

```sql
SELECT average(windowLoad) FROM PageViewTiming 
WHERE (deviceType = 'Desktop') FACET `userAgentName` 
SINCE 604800 seconds AGO TIMESERIES
```
