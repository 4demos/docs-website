With our Blazor WebAssembly dashboard, you can easily monitor your web apps' golden metrics, track end user experience, and see your total page views over time. 

Built with our browser monitoring agent, the Blazor WebAssembly integration gives you a set of pre-built dashboards that let you view your most critical query data, all in one place.

After setting up the Blazor WebAssembly integration with New Relic, your data will display in dashboards like these, right out of the box.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

While the Blazor WebAssembly integration doesn't require the infrastructure agent to collect data, we recommend installation if you want full observability of your system. The infrastructure agent collects logs and other data about your hosts, showing your performance metrics alongside your application metrics. 

There are two methods to install the infrastructure agent:

* Follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=8f14e646-461e-b010-4675-3a0658bb3d20) to instrument your system with the infrastructure agent. 
* [Install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux) via the command line using our docs.

## Integrate Blazor WebAssembly with New Relic [#integrate]

To collect data from Blazor WebAssembly, follow the below procedures: 

1. Install the [browser monitoring agent](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent).
2. Open your Blazor WebAssesmbly application and go to the `wwwroot` directory. Add the following script to the `index.html` file:

```
script here
```
3. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, then click **Metrics & events**. Run a sample NRQL query to confirm New Relic is collecting data: `SELECT average(windowLoad) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (deviceType = 'Desktop') FACET `userAgentName` SINCE 604800 seconds AGO TIMESERIES`
4. To install the dashboard, go to the [Blazor WebAssembly instant observability page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/blazor-web-assembly). Click **Install** at the top of the page. 
5. Go to **Dashboards** from **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)** and click Blazor WebAssembly to view your dashboards.
