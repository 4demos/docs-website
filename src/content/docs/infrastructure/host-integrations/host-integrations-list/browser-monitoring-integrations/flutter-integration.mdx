Our Flutter integration monitors the performance of your Flutter web application, helping you diagnose issues in your application and optimize your code. Our Flutter integration makes use of our browser monitoring agent, and gives you a pre-built dashboard with your most important Flutter app metrics. 

## Install [#install]

### Step 1 (optional): Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

Check the infrastructure agent installation steps in the [documentation](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent)

### Step 2: Install the browser agent [#browser-install] 

Check the browser monitoring agent install steps in the [documentation](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent)

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the [**Add data** page](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace). 
2. Click **Browser and mobile**, then click **Browser monitoring**.
3. Select the **Select copy/paste JavaScript code** option. 
4. Complete the rest of the steps and click **Enable.**

A JavaScript code snippet is generated. Copy that for later use. 

### Step 3. Instrument your Flutter app [#flutter-configure]

1. Go to the `www/root` directory of your Flutter web application.
2. Open the `index.html` file. 
3. Paste our browser code snippet right before the body tag ends (`</body>`).
4. Restart your application. 

## Find your data [#find-data]

To get your Flutter dashboard: 

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the [**Add data** page](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace). 
2. Click on **Dashboards**.
3. In the search bar, type `flutter web`. 
4. The Flutter dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

The Flutter integration makes use of the [browser monitoring events](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/event-data/events-reported-browser-monitoring). Here's an example NRQL query: 

```sql
SELECT average(windowLoad) FROM PageViewTiming 
WHERE (deviceType = 'Desktop') FACET `userAgentName` 
SINCE 604800 seconds AGO TIMESERIES
```
