After setting up the integration with New Relic, see your data in dashboards like these, right out of the box.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

Our infrastructure agent ingests data from your app, then sends your critical metrics to New Relic. There are two methods to install the infrastructure agent:

* Follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=8f14e646-461e-b010-4675-3a0658bb3d20) to instrument your system with the infrastructure agent.
* [Install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux) via the command line using our docs.

## Integrate <APP NAME> with New Relic [#integrate]

Once installed, the infrastructure agent can ingest data from your app and send it to New Relic, but you still need to integrate – or establish a line of communication – between the agent and your app. Once integrated, you can get started with an out of the box monitoring solution for your <APP NAME> app. 

## See <APP NAME> metrics in a dashboard [#dash]

With only the infrastructure agent installed and instrumented with your app, you can view your raw data in our Metrics & events. Our default dashboards transform that raw data into charts and graphs, which provide a bird’s eye view of your system’s health. To install our default dashboards, go to our [<APP NAME> instant observability page](LINK WILL BE PROVIDED AFTER DOC IS LIVE).
