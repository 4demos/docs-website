With our Redmine dashboard, you can easily track your web transaction rate, application error rate, and databases. Built with our Ruby agent, the Redmine quickstart gives you a set of default dashboards that let you view your most critical data all in one place.

## Integrate Redmine with the the Ruby agent [#ruby]

To establish a line of communication between New Relic and your app, you need to install the Ruby agent. You can install the Ruby agent using our [launcher](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=1&state=eb17d004-3569-306a-d693-9506d3d0cf4e), or by following [manual installation](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/installation/install-new-relic-ruby-agent) with our docs.

Once installed, confirm that New Relic is ingesting your Redmine data by going to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capaibilities)**, then clicking **Metrics & events**. Run the following NRQL query to confirm that New Relic is receiving Redmine data:

```sql
SELECT apm.service.transaction.duration FROM Metric
```

## See Redmine metrics in a dashboard [#dash]

Our default dashboards transform that raw data into charts and graphs, which provide a bird’s eye view of your system’s health. To install our default dashboards, go to our [Redmine instant observability page](LINK WILL BE PROVIDED AFTER DOC IS LIVE).
