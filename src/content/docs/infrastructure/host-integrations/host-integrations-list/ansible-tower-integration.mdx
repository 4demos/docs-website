New Relic's Ansible Tower integration takes performance data about your Tower projects and transforms them into pre-built, customizable dashboards.  Track the statuses of your jobs, view your Ansible Tower logs, or see weekly comparisons of your average host load.

[SCREENSHOT OF DASHBOARD]

## Set up Prometheus and the infrastructure agent [#setup]

Our Ansible Tower integration builds on our Prometheus remote write integration. Before you can monitor your Tower projects with New Relic, confirm that you've already set up Prometheus to scrape data from Ansible Tower. You can learn more about this process at [Ansible Tower's docs site](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/administration/metrics.html).

Once Prometheus can scrape data from Ansible Tower, you will need to install our infrastructure agent for Linux systems. This enables log forwarding so your project logs  appear in your custom dashboards. We recommend using our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=1&state=9fc6e1c7-1ffb-1ff0-862d-1ea1ed4a1c31), or you can [install via package manager](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux).

Navigate `/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/`. If you don't see a `logging.yml` file, then create one.

Add this script to the `logging.yml` file:

```
- name: ansible-tower.log
  file: /var/log/tower/tower.log
  attributes:
    logtype: ansible_tower_log
```

From your Prometheus folder, run `./prometheus` to start your server.  In the `prometheus.yml` file, connect to New Relic by adding this script to the file:

```
remote_write:
- url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=prometheus_remote
    bearer_token: 51688d472b5af64a8331801ff621baa8226aNRAL

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
```
