New Relic's Ansible Tower integration takes performance data about your Tower projects and transforms them into pre-built, customizable dashboards.  Track the statuses of your jobs, view your Ansible Tower logs, or see weekly comparisons of your average host load.

[SCREENSHOT OF DASHBOARD]

## Set up Prometheus for Ansible Tower

Our Ansible Tower integration builds on our Prometheus remote write integration. Before you can monitor your Tower projects with New Relic, confirm that you've already set up Prometheus to scrape data from Ansible Tower. You can learn more about this process at [Ansible Tower's docs site](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/administration/metrics.html).

## Get the Tower dashboard

With Prometheus scraping data from your Ansible Tower server, you can now integrate your Prometheus data with New Relic.

1. Install our infrastructure agent for Linux systems with [our guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=1&state=9fc6e1c7-1ffb-1ff0-862d-1ea1ed4a1c31). This enables log forwarding so your project logs appear in your custom dashboard. 
2. Navigate to `/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/`. If there's no `logging.yml` file, then create one. Add this script to the `logging.yml` file:

```
- name: ansible-tower.log
  file: /var/log/tower/tower.log
  attributes:
    logtype: ansible_tower_log
```

3. Using the command line, navigate to your Prometheus folder and run `./prometheus`.  From `prometheus.yml`, connect to New Relic by adding to the file

```
remote_write:
- url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=prometheus_remote
    bearer_token: 51688d472b5af64a8331801ff621baa8226aNRAL

```
