## Set up Prometheus for Ansible Tower

Our Ansible Tower integration builds on our Prometheus remote write integration. Before you can monitor your Tower projects with New Relic, confirm that you've already set up Prometheus to scrape data from Ansible Tower. You can learn more about this process at [Ansible Tower's docs site](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/administration/metrics.html).
