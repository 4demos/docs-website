[HCP Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault) is a hosted version of Vault, which is operated by HashiCorp to allow organizations to get up and running quickly. HCP Vault uses the same binary as self-hosted Vault. You can use the same Vault clients to communicate with HCP Vault as you use to communicate with a self-hosted Vault.

## Enable the integration

Follow these steps to enable the integration.

### Step 1: Follow HCP Vault documentation

Follow the [HCP Vault documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration/telemetry) for Prometheus to discover the metrics endpoints.

### Step 2: Set up Prometheus monitoring

Prometheus metrics needs to be integrated with New Relic, you can use the Prometheus Agent or the Remote Write integration, see [how to send Prometheus metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/).

### Step 3: Checking

Once integrated, use the following query to confirm metrics are being ingested as expected:

```
  FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE metricName LIKE 'vault_%' FACET metricName LIMIT MAX
```

### Step 4: Install the quickstart and see alerts

Install the [HCP Vault quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/hcp%20vault-quickstart) to access built-in dashboards and alerts. 

Once you import the dashboard, you can adapt assets (edit or clon) based on your specific requirements.

## Find and use the data

### Metrics

Prometheus metrics are stored as dimensional metrics. You can [query using NRQL](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data/apis/query-metric-data-type/) or use the [Data Explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer/) to browse the available metrics, facet, and filter by the associated dimensions.

The different sets of metrics exposed by this integration are defined in the [HCP Vault documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/internals/telemetry) and [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/telemetry-metrics-reference#request-handling-metrics).

Use the following NRQL queries to understand the metrics being ingested in New Relic:

* List unique metric names:

  ```
  FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE metricName LIKE 'vault_%' LIMIT MAX
  ```

* Count number of metric updates:

  ```
  FROM Metric SELECT datapointcount() WHERE metricName LIKE 'Vault_%' FACET metricName
  ```

* Estimate data ingestion (daily ingest, in bytes):

	```
  FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() WHERE metricName LIKE 'Vault_%' SINCE 1 day ago
  ```

### Entities

This integration enables `HCP Vault` entities powering the full set of [entity capabilities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) such as golden metrics, entity dashboards, workloads, and lookout.

## Troubleshooting

Follow the troubleshooting tips from [HCP Vault documentation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/troubleshooting-vault) to make sure that metrics are configured as expected on your cluster.

You can also check the specific [troubleshooting guidelines](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-prometheus-integration) for Prometheus integrations.
