[Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/2.12/overview/) is a service mesh for Kubernetes. It makes running services easier and safer by giving you runtime debugging, observability, reliability, and securityâ€”all without requiring any changes to your code.

Linkerd includes the Linkerd-Destination, Linkerd-Identity, Linkder-proxy-injector, Metrics-api, Prometheus, Tap, Tap-injector, and web tabs.

## Enable the integration

Follow these steps to enable the integration.

### Step 1: Follow Linkerd documentation

Follow the [Linkerd documentation](https://linkerd.io/2.12/tasks/external-prometheus/) and [exporting metrics](https://linkerd.io/2.12/tasks/exporting-metrics/) to add the required pod annotations for Prometheus to discover the metrics endpoints.

### Step 2: Set up Prometheus monitoring

Prometheus metrics needs to be integrated with New Relic, you can use the Prometheus Agent or the Remote Write integration, see [how to send Prometheus metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/).

<Callout variant="important">
To match the rules to import the metrics to the entity, you must configure the data source name as `Linkerd_Prometheus` when you are creating your New Relic Prometheus remote write configuration.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Checking

Once integrated, use the following query to confirm metrics are being ingested as expected:

```
  FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE instrumentation.name = 'remote-write' AND instrumentation.source = 'Linkerd_Prometheus' FACET metricName LIMIT MAX
```

### Step 4: Install the quickstart and see alerts

Install the [Linkerd quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/linkerd-quickstart) to access built-in dashboards and alerts. 

Once you import the dashboard, you can adapt assets (edit or clon) based on your specific requirements.

## Find and use the data

### Metrics

Prometheus metrics are stored as dimensional metrics. You can [query using NRQL](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data/apis/query-metric-data-type/) or use the [Data Explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer/) to browse the available metrics, facet, and filter by the associated dimensions.

The different sets of metrics exposed by this integration are defined in the [Linkerd documentation](https://linkerd.io/2.12/reference/proxy-metrics/).

Use the following NRQL queries to understand the metrics being ingested in New Relic:

* List unique metric names:

  ```
  FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName)  WHERE instrumentation.name = 'remote-write' AND instrumentation.source = 'Linkerd_Prometheus' LIMIT MAX ```
  ```

* Count number of metric updates:

  ```
  FROM Metric SELECT datapointcount()  WHERE instrumentation.name = 'remote-write' AND instrumentation.source = 'Linkerd_Prometheus' FACET metricName LIMIT MAX ```
  ```

* Estimate data ingestion (daily ingest, in bytes):

	```
  FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()   WHERE instrumentation.name = 'remote- write' AND instrumentation.source = 'Linkerd_Prometheus' SINCE 1 day ago ```
  ```

### Entities

This integration enables `Linkerd` entities powering the full set of [entity capabilities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) such as golden metrics, entity dashboards, workloads, and lookout.

## Troubleshooting

Follow the troubleshooting tips from [Linkerd documentation](https://linkerd.io/2.12/getting-started/) to make sure that metrics are configured as expected on your cluster.

You can also check the specific [troubleshooting guidelines](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-prometheus-integration) for Prometheus integrations.
