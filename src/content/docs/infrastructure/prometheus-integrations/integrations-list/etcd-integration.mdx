[Etcd](https://etcd.io/) is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. It gracefully handles leader elections during network partitions and can tolerate machine failure, even in the leader node.

Etcd is:

* Simple: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)
* Secure: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication
* Fast: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec
* Reliable: properly distributed using Raft

Etcd can monitor:

* Leader changes
* Server proposals failures and committed
* gRPC stats
* Disk write latency

Use New Relic to display a curated dashboard based on Prometheus metrics which helps you understand the health of your Etcd cluster.

## Enable the integration

Follow these steps to enable the integration.

### Step 1: Follow Etcd documentation

Follow the [Etcd documentation](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/monitoring/) for Prometheus to discover the metrics endpoints.

### Step 2: Set up Prometheus monitoring

Prometheus metrics needs to be integrated with New Relic, you can use the Prometheus Agent or the Remote Write integration, see [how to send Prometheus metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/).

### Step 3: Checking

Once integrated, use the following query to confirm metrics are being ingested as expected:

```
  FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE metricName LIKE 'etcd_%' FACET metricName LIMIT MAX
```

### Step 4: Install the quickstart and see alerts

Install the [Etcd quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/etcd) to access built-in dashboards and alerts. 

Once you import the dashboard, you can adapt assets (edit or clon) based on your specific requirements.

## Find and use the data

### Metrics

Prometheus metrics are stored as dimensional metrics. You can [query using NRQL](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data/apis/query-metric-data-type/) or use the [Data Explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer/) to browse the available metrics, facet, and filter by the associated dimensions.

The different sets of metrics exposed by this integration are defined in the [Etcd documentation](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/metrics/).

Use the following NRQL queries to understand the metrics being ingested in New Relic:

* List unique metric names:

  ```
  FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE metricName LIKE ‘etcd_%’  LIMIT MAX
  ```

* Count number of metric updates:

  ```
  FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE metricName LIKE 'etcd_%'  LIMIT MAX
  ```

* Estimate data ingestion (daily ingest, in bytes):

	```
  FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() WHERE metricName LIKE 'etcd_%' SINCE
1 day ago
  ```

### Entities

TBD.

## Troubleshooting

Follow the troubleshooting tips from [Etcd documentation](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/monitoring/) to make sure that metrics are configured as expected on your cluster.

You can also check the specific [troubleshooting guidelines](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-prometheus-integration) for Prometheus integrations.
