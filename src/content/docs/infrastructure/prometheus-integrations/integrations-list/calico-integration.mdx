[Calico CNI](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico) is a widely adopted, battle-tested open source networking, and network security solution for Kubernetes, virtual machines, and bare-metal workloads. Calico provides two major services for Cloud Native applications:

* Network connectivity between workloads.
* Network security policy enforcement between workloads.

Calico can monitor:

* Active network policies by instances
* Active IP tables rules by instances and chain type (filter, mangle, nat, and raw)
* IP tables save and restore errors
* BPF specific metrics if BPF is used as a dataplane for Calico

Use New Relic to display a curated dashboard based on Prometheus metrics which helps you understand the Calico CNI of your k8s cluster.

## Enable the integration

Follow these steps to enable the integration.

### Step 1: Follow Calico documentation

Follow the [Calico documentation](https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/maintenance/monitor/monitor-component-metrics) for Prometheus to discover the Calico metrics endpoints.

### Step 2: Set up Prometheus monitoring

Prometheus metrics needs to be integrated with New Relic, you can use the Prometheus Agent or the Remote Write integration, see [how to send Prometheus metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/).

### Step 3: Checking

Once integrated, use the following query to confirm metrics are being ingested as expected:

```
  FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE metricName LIKE 'felix_%' FACET metricName LIMIT MAX
```

### Step 4: Install the quickstart and see alerts

Install the [Calico quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/calico-newrelic) to access built-in dashboards and and [alerts](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts/).

Once imported, assets can be adapted (edited or cloned) based on your specific requirements. 

## Find and use the data

### Metrics

Prometheus metrics are stored as dimensional metrics. You can [query using NRQL](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data/apis/query-metric-data-type/) or use the [Data Explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer/) to browse the available metrics, facet, and filter by the associated dimensions.

The different sets of metrics exposed by this integration are defined in the [Calico documentation](https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/reference/felix/prometheus).

Use the following NRQL queries to understand the metrics being ingested in New Relic:

* List unique metric names:

  ```
  FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE metricName LIKE 'felix_%' LIMIT MAX
  ```

* Count number of metric updates:

  ```
  FROM Metric SELECT datapointcount() WHERE metricName LIKE 'felix_%' LIMIT MAX
  ```

* Estimate data ingestion (daily ingest, in bytes):

	```
  FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() WHERE metricName LIKE 'felix_%' SINCE
1 day ago
  ```

### Entities

TBD.

## Troubleshooting

* Use this command to verify that he Calico Prometheus endpoint is emitting metrics on any K8s node configured with Calico CNI:

  ```
  curl <Calico-Pod-IP>:9091/metrics
  ```

* Follow the troubleshooting tips from [Calico documentation](https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/maintenance/monitor/monitor-component-metrics) to make sure that metrics are configured as expected on your cluster.

* You can also check the specific [troubleshooting guidelines](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-prometheus-integration) for Prometheus integrations.
