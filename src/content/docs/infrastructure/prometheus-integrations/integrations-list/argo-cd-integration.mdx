[Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It enables automated, auditable application deployment, and lifecycle management that is easy to understand. Argo CD exposes Server and Application Controller metrics.

Use Argo CD to monitor:
* Sync activity and status
* Health status
* Controller, Repo, and Argo server statistics

## Requirements

Follow the [Argo CD documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/metrics/#prometheus-operator) to add the required pod annotations for Prometheus to discover the metrics endpoints.

## Enable the integration

Prometheus metrics needs to be integrated with New Relic, you can use the Prometheus Agent or the Remote Write integration, see [how to send Prometheus metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/).

Once integrated, use the following query to confirm metrics are being ingested as expected:

```
  FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE metricName LIKE ‘argocd_%’ FACET metricName LIMIT MAX
```

Argo CD entities are also visible in [New Relic Explorer](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts/) with associated golden metrics and a built-in entity dashboard. 

## Install dashboards and alerts

Install the [Argo CD quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/argocd-quickstart) to access built-in dashboards and alerts.
Once you import the dashboard, you can adapt assets (edit or clon) based on your specific requirements.

## Find and use the data

### Metrics

Prometheus metrics are stored as dimensional metrics. You can [query using NRQL](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data/apis/query-metric-data-type/) or use the [Data Explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer/) to browse the available metrics, facet, and filter by the associated dimensions.

The different sets of metrics exposed by Argo CD are defined in the [Argo CD documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/metrics/).

Use the following NRQL queries to understand the metrics being ingested in New Relic:

* List unique metric names:

  ```
  FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE metricName LIKE ‘argocd_%’  LIMIT MAX
  ```

* Count number of metric updates:

  ```
  FROM Metric SELECT datapointcount() WHERE metricName LIKE 'argocd_%' FACET metricName
  ```

* Estimate data ingestion (daily ingest, in bytes):

	```
  FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() WHERE metricName LIKE 'argocd_%' SINCE 1 day ago
  ```

### Entities

This integration enables `Argo CD` entities powering the full set of [entity capabilities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) such as golden metrics, entity dashboards, Workloads, and Lookout.

## Troubleshooting

Follow the troubleshooting tips from [Argo CD documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/troubleshooting/) to make sure that metrics are configured as expected on your cluster.

You can also check the specific [troubleshooting guidelines](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-prometheus-integration) for Prometheus integrations.
