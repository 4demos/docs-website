[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/features/?stage=plan) helps you automate the builds, integration, and verification of your code. Your teams get quick insights about every commit, so they can deliver higher quality code faster with SAST, DAST, code quality analysis, and plus pipelines that enable concurrent testing and parallel execution.

## Enable the integration

Follow these steps to enable the integration.

### Step 1: Follow GitLab documentation

Follow the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/prometheus/) for Prometheus to discover the metrics endpoints.

### Step 2: Set up Prometheus monitoring

Prometheus metrics needs to be integrated with New Relic, you can use the Prometheus Agent or the Remote Write integration, see [how to send Prometheus metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/get-started/send-prometheus-metric-data-new-relic/).

### Step 3: Checking

Once integrated, use the following query to confirm metrics are being ingested as expected:

```
  FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE prometheus_server LIKE 'gitlab_%' FACET metricName LIMIT MAX
```

### Step 4: Install the quickstart and see alerts

Install the [GitLab quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/gitlab-quickstart) to access built-in dashboards and alerts. 

Once you import the dashboard, you can adapt assets (edit or clon) based on your specific requirements.

## Find and use the data

### Metrics

Prometheus metrics are stored as dimensional metrics. You can [query using NRQL](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data/apis/query-metric-data-type/) or use the [Data Explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer/) to browse the available metrics, facet, and filter by the associated dimensions.

The different sets of metrics exposed by this integration are defined in the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/prometheus/gitlab_metrics.html).

Use the following NRQL queries to understand the metrics being ingested in New Relic:

* List unique metric names:

  ```
  FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE prometheus_server LIKE 'gitlab_%' LIMIT MAX
  ```

* Count number of metric updates:

  ```
  FROM Metric SELECT datapointcount() WHERE prometheus_server LIKE 'gitlab_%' FACET metricName
  ```

* Estimate data ingestion (daily ingest, in bytes):

	```
  FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() WHERE prometheus_server LIKE 'gitlab_%' SINCE 1 day ago
  ```

### Entities

This integration enables `GitLab` entities powering the full set of [entity capabilities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) such as golden metrics, entity dashboards, workloads, and lookout.

## Troubleshooting

Follow the troubleshooting tips from [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/troubleshooting.html) to make sure that metrics are configured as expected on your cluster.

You can also check the specific [troubleshooting guidelines](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-prometheus-integration) for Prometheus integrations.
