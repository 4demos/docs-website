Our Ansible Automation Platform integration takes performance data about your projects and transforms them into pre-built, customizable dashboards. Track the statuses of your jobs, view your Ansible Automation Platform logs, or see weekly comparisons of your average host load.

## Set up Prometheus and the infrastructure agent [#setup]

Before you can monitor your Ansible Automation Platform projects with New Relic, you need to:

1. Confirm that you've set up Prometheus to scrape data from Ansible Automation Platform. You can learn more about this process at [Ansible Automation Platform's docs site](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/administration/metrics.html).
2. Install our infrastructure agent for Linux systems. This enables log forwarding so your project logs appear in your custom dashboards. We recommend using our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=1&state=9fc6e1c7-1ffb-1ff0-862d-1ea1ed4a1c31), or if the command line is more your style, you can also [install via package manager](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux).

## Get Ansible Automation Platform metrics in a dashboard [#dash]

Our Ansible Automation Platform integration builds atop our Prometheus remote write integration, where you use your own Prometheus server. To view your data in our dashboard, follow the below steps to integrate Ansible Automation Platform, Prometheus, and the New Relic platform. 

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser
    id="logging"
    title="Step 1. Connect Ansible Automation Platform logs to the infrastructure agent"
  >
Navigate `/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/`. If you don't see a `logging.yml` file, then create one.

Add this snippet to the `logging.yml` file:

```yml
- name: ansible-tower.log
  file: /var/log/tower/tower.log
  attributes:
    logtype: ansible_tower_log
```
</Collapser>
<Collapser
  id="integrate"
  title="Step 2. Integrate Prometheus in the New Relic platform"
  >
In the `prometheus.yml` file, add this snippet:

```yml
remote_write:
  - url: "YOUR URL"
    bearer_token: "YOUR TOKEN"
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
  static_configs:
    - targets: ["localhost:9100"]
```

This snippet: 

* Connects Prometheus to the New Relic platform via `remote_write`. 
* Sets `"prometheus"` as the target so it can scrape data from itself.
</Collapser>
<Collapser
  id="jobs"
  title="Step 3. Grab Ansible Automation Platform metrics"
>

With data from Prometheus exposed to New Relic, you can now integrate your Ansible Automation Platform projects into the New Relic platform. 

Add this snippet to that same  `prometheus.yml` file: 

  ```yml
- job_name: "tower"
    tls_config: 
      insecure_skip_verify: true
    metrics_path: /api/v2/metrics
    scrape_interval: 5s
    scheme: https
    bearer_token: "YOUR_TOKEN"
    static_configs: 
      - targets:  ["localhost:443"]
- job name: "node"
    static_configs: 
      targets: ['localhost:9100']
```

This snippet:

* Puts Ansible Automation Platform as the target to scrape data from.
* Sets a metric path to pull that scraped data.
* Defines the scrape interval.

  title="Step 4. Build NRQL queries for metrics and logs"
>
With your data ingested and displaying in your dashboard, customize the dashboard based on your team's needs. New Relic dashboards are built and generated with NRQL queries.

To get this dashboard, for example:

<img
  title="Ansible Automation Platform metrics dashboard"
  alt="A screenshot that shows a metrics dashboard"
  src={ansibleQueryMetrics}
/>

You would use this query:

```sql
FROM Metric SELECT count(status) FACET status SINCE 7 days ago WHERE prometheus_server = 'prometheus_remote' AND job = 'tower'
```

For a dashboard that shows your Ansible Automation Platform logs, you might try:

```sql
FROM Log SELECT * WHERE logtype = 'ansible_tower_log'
```

This query generates this dashboard:

<img
  title="Ansible Automation Platform logs dashboard"
  alt="A screenshot that shows a logs dashboard"
  src={ansibleLogsQuery}
/>

To view any of the queries behind your dashboards, click the three dots in the upper right of a dashboard. Click **View query**.
