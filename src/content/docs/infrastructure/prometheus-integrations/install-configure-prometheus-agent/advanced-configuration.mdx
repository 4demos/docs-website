## Prevent billing increases [#rate-limits]

Avoid sending Prometheus data that isn't relevant to your monitoring needs. Instead, use filters to ignore or include specific metrics, which will help you control the amount of data you send to New Relic and also avoid additional billing charges.

As explained in the [configuration guide](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/setup-prometheus-agent), some targets will be scraped by default, and all the data that's exposed from those discovered targets will be sent. In consequence, you may exceed New Relic's platform limits and increase your billing charges.

Also, see our [troubleshooting tips](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/troubleshooting-guide).

## Apply Prometheus native configuration

If you have some kind of requirement which is not currently supported by the configuration layer the New Relic's prometheus agent provides, you can set up additional scrape configuration in Prometheus format. To do so, you can use the `extra_` fields including valid Prometheus configuration which will not be parsed in any way.

<Callout title="WARNING">
  `extra_` fields should include raw Prometheus config.
</Callout>

Therefore, the metrics collected won't have by default the metadata (pod_name, service_name, ...) added by the agent for the Static targets or kubernetes jobs. This configuration should be used as a workaround whenever the supported fields do not cover a particular use-case. You can see more details in the [helm-chart documentation](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-prometheus-configurator/blob/main/charts/newrelic-prometheus-agent/README.md).
