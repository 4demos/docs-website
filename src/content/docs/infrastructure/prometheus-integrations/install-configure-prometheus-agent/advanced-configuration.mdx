## Prevent billing increases [#rate-limits]

Avoid sending Prometheus data that isn't relevant to your monitoring needs. Instead, use filters to ignore or include specific metrics, which help you control the amount of data you send to New Relic and avoid additional billing charges.

As explained in the [configuration guide](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/setup-prometheus-agent), some targets are scraped by default, and all the data that's exposed from those discovered targets is sent. So you may exceed New Relic's platform limits and increase your billing charges.

If you need to reduce the amount of data being set, you can customize the prometheus agent configuration:

* By setting up [what targets are being scraped](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/setup-prometheus-agent#scrape-prometheus-integrations).
* By adjusting the [scarpe interval](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/setup-prometheus-agent#target-scrape-interval).
* By applying [metric filters](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/setup-prometheus-agent#drop-keep-metrics).
* By configuring the [what prometheus integrations are enabled](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/advanced-configuration#enable-disable-integrations).

Also, see our [troubleshooting tips](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/troubleshooting-guide).

## Enable or disable prometheus integrations [#enable-disable-integrations]

New Relic prometheus agent uses the `app_values` and `source_labels` fields to scrape metrics from prometheus integrations. This is easily customizable. You can check the default values in [the chart repository](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-prometheus-configurator/blob/main/charts/newrelic-prometheus-agent/values.yaml).

* `source_labels` defines the labels names to be used to filter metrics from the corresponding resources.
* `app_values` defines the values of those label names which will be filtered.

For instance, the values:

```yaml
# (...)
kubernetes:
  source_labels: ["app.kubernetes.io/name", "app.newrelic.io/name"]
  app_values: ["redis"]
# (...)
```

Would make all jobs with `integrations_filter.enabled: true` to include only the metrics including the labels corresponding to `"app.kubernetes.io/name"` and `"app.newrelic.io/name"` whose value is `"redis"`.

The default values can be extended to include additional labels or application values or reduced if some of the services referred in the default application values are available in your cluster but you are only interested only in a subset of them.


## Apply Prometheus native configuration [#native-config]

If you have some kind of requirement which is not currently supported by the configuration layer the New Relic's Prometheus agent provides, you can set up additional scrape configuration in Prometheus format. To do so, use the `extra_` fields including valid Prometheus configuration which will not be parsed in any way.

<Callout variant='important'>
  `extra_` fields should include raw Prometheus configuration.
</Callout>

Therefore, the metrics collected won't have by default the metadata such as `pod_name` or `service_name` added by the agent for the static targets or kubernetes jobs. Use this configuration only as a workaround when the supported fields don't cover your needs. See more details in the [helm-chart documentation](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-prometheus-configurator/blob/main/charts/newrelic-prometheus-agent/README.md).
