You can get started either by jumping right into the instrumentation of your own service, or you can instrument some sample applications. Here are some options you can choose from:

* Set up OpenTelemetry on your own code
    * Instrument your own service
    * Instrument your collector
    * Instrument Kubernetes
* Practice the OpenTelemetry setup on a sample
