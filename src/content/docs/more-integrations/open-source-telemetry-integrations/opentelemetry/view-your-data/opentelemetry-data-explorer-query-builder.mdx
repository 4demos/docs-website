Here are some tips about how to find your telemetry in New Relic:

## View your metrics and traces [#general-metrics-traces]

You can look at your metrics and traces using [data explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer), or write your own queries in query builder using NRQL. For more on how to query your data once it's in New Relic, see [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/explore-data/introduction-querying-new-relic-data) and [Introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language).

## Events API (experimental) [#events-api]

OpenTelemetry recently introduced the experimental [Events API](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/logs/event-api/) in its specification. This API allows you to create an `EventLogger`, which can emit `Events` as `LogRecords` containing two special attributes:
* `event.domain`: the domain of the emitted events. It needs to be be set during the creation of the `EventLogger`.
* `event.name`: the event name. This attribute is what New Relic uses to map an OpenTelemetry event into a [New Relic eventType](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/data-requirements-limits-custom-event-data/#general)

So, if your application emits an event with `event.domain=DefaultEventDomain` and `event.name=ApiRequest`, you will be able to find these events under the `ApiRequest` eventType in New Relic:

Note that both `event.type` and `event.domain` need to be included in the OpenTelemetry events for them to become available as events in New Relic. The OpenTelemetry Events API already [enforces this](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/logs/event-api/) through the `EventLogger` and `Events` constructor or factory method interfaces.
