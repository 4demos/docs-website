In addition to viewing your OpenTelemetry data in our curated views, you can also view data by constructing your own custom queries. Our **Metrics & events**  and **Query builder** pages can help you dig into your data.

## Metrics & events [#general-metrics-traces]

The tool called **Metrics & events** helps you construct queries of metrics, logs, and traces without having to use the NRQL query language directly. You can also query events, but you'll need to sign up for a private preview that's explained below in [Query your data using NRQL](#query-builder).

You can find **Metrics & events** at [one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities). For tips about how to use this, see [Introduction to the metrics and events data explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer).

## Query builder [#query-builder]

If you prefer to write your own database queries using NRQL, you can use our tool called query builder. You can find this tool in **Query your data** at [one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities). To learn more about how to construct queries with NRQL, see [Introduction to querying data in New Relic](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/explore-data/introduction-querying-new-relic-data) and [Introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language).

<Callout title="Private preview">
  If you sign up to participate in the private preview of the Events API, you can also query OpenTelemetry events using the query builder. Let us know in our [CNCF Slack channel, #otel-newrelic](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C024DRQ63UP) if you'd like to participate.

OpenTelemetry recently introduced the experimental [Events API](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/logs/event-api/) in its specification. This API allows you to create an `EventLogger`, which can emit `Events` as `LogRecords` containing two special attributes:
* `event.domain`: The domain of the emitted events. It needs to be be set during the creation of the `EventLogger`.
* `event.name`: The event name. This attribute is what New Relic uses to map an OpenTelemetry event into a [New Relic eventType](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/data-requirements-limits-custom-event-data/#general)

So, if your application emits an event with `event.domain=DefaultEventDomain` and `event.name=ApiRequest`, you will be able to find these events under the `ApiRequest` eventType in New Relic. Here's an example of how to view the data using query builder:

<img
  title="OpenTelemetry events queried through the query builder"
  alt="Screenshot showing how OpenTelemetry events having event.type='ApiRequest' can be queried in the query builder using SELECT * FROM ApiRequest"
  src={otelEventsQueryScreenshot}
/>

Note that both `event.type` and `event.domain` need to be included in the OpenTelemetry events for them to become available as events in New Relic. The OpenTelemetry Events API already [enforces this](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/logs/event-api/) through the `EventLogger` and `Events` constructor or factory method interfaces.
