Errors inbox is a single place to proactively detect, triage, and take action on all the errors before they impact customers. Errors are grouped intelligently  to cut down on noise to ensure that critical errors are detected more easily.
Receive alerts whenever a critical, customer-impacting error arises via your preferred communication channel, like Slack.

Resolve errors faster with errors from across your stack, including all APM, browser (RUM), mobile, and serverless (AWS Lambda) data, and Otel displayed on one screen.

## Get started [#get-started]

There are two ways to start using errors inbox: 

* Scoped view – Navigate to a supported entity: APM, Browser, Mobile, or Otel and start viewing your errors right away. No setup required! 
* Global view – Select errors inbox from the navigation menu and select the entities that are of interest to you. You will start viewing error groups for those entities right away. You have the option to save this view as a workload.

 ###  Global view [#global-inbox]

You can view error groups for multiple entities in the global view. We understand that a team generally oversees a number of services and consolidating this information in one inbox is more effective for their workflow. 

You can group APM, Browser, Mobile, Serverless, and Otel entities together and save your curated view as a workload in two steps that take less than a minute.
