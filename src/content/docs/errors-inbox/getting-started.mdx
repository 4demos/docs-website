Errors inbox is a single place to proactively detect, triage, and take action on all the errors before they impact customers. Errors are grouped intelligently  to cut down on noise to ensure that critical errors are detected quickly and efficiently.

Receive alerts whenever a critical, customer-impacting error arises via your preferred communication channel, like Slack.

Resolve errors faster with errors from across your stack, including all APM, browser (RUM), mobile, and serverless (AWS Lambda) data, and Otel displayed on one screen.

## Get started [#get-started]

There are two ways to start using errors inbox: 

* Scoped view – Navigate to a supported entity: APM, Browser, Mobile, or Otel and start viewing your errors right away. No setup required! 
* Global view – Select errors inbox from the navigation menu and select the entities that are of interest to you. You will start viewing error groups for those entities right away. You have the option to save this view as a workload.

### Scoped view [#scoped-inbox]
[Entity] (/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) scoped views allow you to view errors for a single APM, browser, mobile, or your
[OpenTelemetry application](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-introduction/#benefits). You can access the errors inbox view for a specific entity by navigating to that entity in the APM, browser, mobile, or OpenTelemetry monitoring view and selecting Errors inbox in the left nav under

 ###  Global view [#global-inbox]

You can view error groups for multiple entities in the global view. We understand that a team generally oversees a number of services and consolidating this information in one inbox is more effective for their workflow. 

You can group APM, Browser, Mobile, Serverless, and Otel entities together and save your curated view as a workload in two steps that take less than a minute.

* In the dropdown menu, select the entities that you want to save as a workload and select the ‘Save as workload' button. 
* The entities you've preselected will be automatically added and you have the option to add more. Select  'Create a workload'once you have all the entities you need. 
* All done! View all your entities in a workload from now on.
