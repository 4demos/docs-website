With applied intelligence's postmortems, events/metrics and metadata are automatically collected to form a data content-ready template to help you complete an accurate and well-written postmortem with minimum efforts.

## What is a postmortem? [#postmortem]

A postmortem is the retrospective process and record of an incident, including descriptions and timeline of the incident, the impact and root causes, as well as the mitigation measures and follow-up action items to prevent the incident from recurring in the future.

## Why create an instant postmortem? [#why-postmortem]
Preparing postmortems are part of the best practices after an outage just got resolved, when team members have fresh memory and thinking.
With applied intelligence's postmortems, you can save time for surfacing facts and data, and focus more on the actual incident analysis and action items for future improvements. With this hassle-free postmortem creation experience, applied intelligence's postmortems feature helps your team form an efficient postmortem routine.

## Create a postmortem [#create-postmortem]

The postmortems feature is located under the Alerts & AI menu in the UI. There are several entry points to help you start a postmortem conveniently. One of the options is to build a postmortem immediately after closing an issue, or for a closed issue on-spot.
Issues are groups of incidents that describe the underlying problem of your symptoms. When a new incident is created, incident intelligence opens an issue and evaluates other open issues for correlations. For more information see [Use Incident Intelligence](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/use-incident-intelligence/).

Follow these recommended steps to create an accurate and resourceful postmortem with a smooth experience.

Ready to get started? Make sure you have a [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup). It's free, forever!

## Step 1: Enter postmortem page [#step1-enter-postmortem-page]

Go to [one.newrelic.com](one.newrelic.com) > **Alerts & AI** > **Analyze**, and click **Issues & activity**. 
From Issue feed, click a target issue for your postmortem.
If the issue is still open, click Close issue when necessary.
Click **Create Postmortem** for your closed issue. 

## Step 2: Review, edit, and comment on timeline [#step2-edit-event-timeline]

Postmortem feature collects the events and metadata during the timeframe of the issue lifespan by default, and automatically forms an event timeline. The event types include [Anomaly](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/proactive-detection/proactive-detection-applied-intelligence/), [Incident](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/use-incident-intelligence/), [Alert violation](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts/), Deployment(/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/events/deployments-page-view-impact-your-app-users/) and User.

Each event is framed in an event card. You can review the timeline of events, optionally delete any event card, or add a user event.

<figcaption>
  In the `Incident` event, a set of tags are listed to give you extra contexts. Each type of event is labeled with a different color to help distinguish between events. You can also collapse the event card temporarily by clicking the left corner "arrow" icon to have a simple view. In this example, the top `Anomaly` card is collapsed to hide details.
</figcaption>

<Callout variant="tip">
  To add a note as a user event on the timeline, move your mouse below any card, you will see an "Insert card" option. Click on it, enter contexts, and save.
</Callout>

<img

  alt="Screenshot of New Relic Postmortem Timeline Insert User Card"
  src={postmortem2}
/>

Once you have reviewed all essential events, optionally insert charts for events to show data metrics and trends. Within an event card, click on the **Insert charts** button. A collection of relevant charts about the event will pop up. Select one or more charts by checking the selection box to insert within the event.

<Callout variant="important">
  The retention of the charts are the same as the respective underlying metrics/events retention configured for your account [retention](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention/). To update retention for charts, please adjust your data retention accordingly.
</Callout>

Comment under an event. Users have the option to add comments under any type of event on the timeline. Click the **Comment** button and enter your comment. Click **Save comment** to put the comment under the event.

<figcaption>
  The comment sections serve as a communication channel, to easily form a panel, and can be very handy to expand discussions, complement information about a particular event, address obscurities, and inspire future actions to prevent similar incidents from recurring.
</figcaption>

## Step 3: Review metadata [#step3-review-metadata]

Associated issue and entities sections are automatically filled out. You have the option to delete any associated entity.

On the top of the page, select the impact (severity) level of the incident the postmortem reports for. This indicator also shows on the postmortem list page.

Optionally, adjust start/end time in the `TimeFrame` to reflect the time period of the incident. (incident here means the general incident concept rather than the `Incident` event type.)

## Step 4: Fill out context sections [#step4-fill-out-context-sections]

Title and "What happened" summary sections are required. The metadata sections and events timeline should give you essential contexts about what entities are affected, when and how. Optional: Fill out the Root cause and Recovery actions sections for a more detailed retrospective record.

Click **Create Postmortem** to save the postmortem.

## View your postmortems [#view-postmortems]

It is helpful to look at your past postmortems for insights when an incident happens. Reviewing a newly created postmortem with your team immediately after the incident happened also helps verify the record information and align on future actions.

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](one.newrelic.com) > **Alerts & AI** > **Analyze**, and click **Issues & activity**. Then click **Postmortems** tab.
2. You will see a list of postmortems, sorted by latest creation time.
3. Click on an individual postmortem to look at the detailed postmortem record.
4. Optional: To delete a postmortem, click the **Delete** button.
