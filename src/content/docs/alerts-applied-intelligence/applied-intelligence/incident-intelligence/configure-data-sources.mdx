## Configure sources [#configure-sources]

After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs.

You can get data from any of the following sources:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="configure-source-nr-alerts"
    title="Alerts"
  >
    By integrating incident intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring.

    To get data from alerts:

    1. From **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, click **Alerts**.
    2. On the left under **incident intelligence**, click **Sources** and then click **Alerts**.
    3. Select the policies you want to connect to applied intelligence, and click **Connect**.

       You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in **Sources > Alerts**.

       <Callout variant="tip">
         Adding alerts as a source will not affect your current configuration or notifications.

  <Collapser

    id="configure-aporia"

    By integrating incident intelligence with your Aporia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Aporia integration, see our [docs](/docs/integrations/mlops-integrations/aporia-mlops-integration/).

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="configure-aporia"
    title="Superwise (MLOps)"
  >
    By integrating incident intelligence with your Superwise machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Superwise integration, see our [docs](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/mlops/integrations/superwise-mlops-integration/).

    Incident intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event.

    * A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI.
    * An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe.

      You can also send any type of data to incident intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. 

      For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see [REST API for New Relic applied intelligence](/docs/rest-api-new-relic-ai).
