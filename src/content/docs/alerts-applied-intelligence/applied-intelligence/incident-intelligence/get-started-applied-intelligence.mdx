As the digital world continues to grow more tangled and complex it is easy for Devops teams to feel overwhelmed. There are so many new data points, dashboards, entities, and alerts that it can be hard for on-call teams to know what's happening where, and what to do about it. New Relic's applied intelligence was designed to end response fatigue so your team can not only detect and diagnose incidents, but prioritize them for immediate action.

Applied intelligence alerts your team to potential problems by first identifying anomalous behavior, correlating any relevant incidents, and then alerting your team of relevant issues. Applied intelligence was created for busy, Devops teams because it reduces noise but ensures you never miss an issue.

## Detect [#detect-intro]

Through applied intelligence, New Relic constantly observes your telemetry data and can detects the instant there are any deviations from normal behavior. We analyze this irregular behavior through our [anomaly](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-applied-intelligence/)detection. You can decide what level of automation works best for each circumstance. Our automatic anomaly detection is easy to use and implement, while our more customizable detection options offer your team the ability to make create alerts that are just right for you. 

The table below outlines our options and their use cases:

## Connect [#workflow-intro]

Once you've used our anomaly detection to identify irregular behavior, it's important that the right people on your team are notified right away. New Relic created workflows so you can control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues. Workflows allow you to funnel the right information to the relevant person or team, and enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data.

To learn how to set up workflows, follow our step by step guide by [checking out our workflows docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows).

## Notify [#destination-intro]

After you've created a workflow that connects that you've set up your workflows, you can configure your destinations, which are the data outputs where you view your issues.

* Destinations are where we send notifications about your New Relic data. A destination is a unique identifier for a third-party system that you use.
* Destination settings contain the connection details to integrate with third-party systems and can be used across a variety of tools in New Relic.

To learn how to set up destinations and configure message templates, [check the documentation on notifications](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/destinations/).
