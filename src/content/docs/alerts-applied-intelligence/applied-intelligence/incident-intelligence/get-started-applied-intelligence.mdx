Applied intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events.

## Detect [#detect-intro]

Through AI & Alerting, New Relic detects changes in your telemetry data.

There are automatic and customizable detection options. The table below outlines our options and their use cases:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Option
      </th>

      <th>
        Automation Level
      </th>

      <th>
        When To Use
      </th>

       <th>
        Coverage
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Static
      </td>

      <td>
        Entirely configurable
      </td>

      <td>
         When you need to set one single threshold for all your data 
      </td>

       <td>
        All Entities, All Signals
       </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Anomaly (Configurable)
      </td>

      <td>
        Semi-automated
      </td>

      <td>
         When you want to automatically learn trends in your data but have control over the threshold
      </td>

       <td>
        All Entities, All Signals
       </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Automatic Anomaly
      </td>

      <td>
        Completely automatic
      </td>

      <td>
         A broad understanding of changes in key metrics on your applications & services with no configuration needed. Data trends and thresholds are automatically determined through our Machine Learning engine
      </td>

       <td>
        APM Entities, Golden Signals
       </td>
    </tr>

Alerts lets you define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, letting you focus on the things you care about most.


## Workflows [#workflow-intro]

With workflows you control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues, tunnel the right information to the relevant person or team, and enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data.

To learn how to set up workflows, follow our step by step guide by [checking out our workflows docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows).

## Destinations [#destination-intro]

Now that you've set up your workflows, you can configure your destinations, which are the data outputs where you view your issues.
 
Destinations are where we send notifications about your New Relic data. A destination is a unique identifier for a third-party system that you use.
Destination settings contain the connection details to integrate with third-party systems and can be used across a variety of tools in New Relic.
 
To learn how to set up destinations and configure message templates, [check the documentation on notifications](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/destinations/).
