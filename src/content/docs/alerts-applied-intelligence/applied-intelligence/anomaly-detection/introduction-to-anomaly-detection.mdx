With applied intelligence's anomaly detection, New Relic alerts your team of any unusual behavior. New Relic observes your APM-monitored applications and understands baseline, or normal, performance. If behavior deviates from the baseline, we know right away and alert your team so you can address any errors promptly and efficiently.

## How we use anomalies [#anomalies-in-use]

At New Relic, our own developers monitor the health of our application. They want to know if there are any outliers in our system's performance as soon as possible because our customers should always have access to the data they need. New Relic's anomaly detection monitors three key golden signals: throughput, error rate and latency. Since we monitor our own application, New Relic developers always understand our baseline performance for these metrics. 

So, let's say that one afternoon there's a spike in response time and it's taking longer than usual for our customers to access the New Relic application. New Relic will flag this anomalous behavior because our latency metric data has deviated from its baseline. This doesn't necessarily mean there is a problem, it just indicates that New Relic has registered something out of the ordinary in our system and we should take a deeper look.

We can monitor this unusual behavior in a few ways.  

First, our team uses the anomaly dashboard so we can see what changed and when.

We also set up notifications for anomalies to be delivered in Slack, and we set up a webhook to deliver messages when we need them.

These events are also available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. After we set up an anomaly detection configuration (a group of apps weâ€™re interested in), we can add this configuration as a source. Then the anomalies will be automatically correlated with other data sources via incident intelligence.
