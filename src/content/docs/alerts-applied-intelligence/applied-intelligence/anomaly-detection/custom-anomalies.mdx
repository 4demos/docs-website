## Custom anomalies [#custom-anomalies]

First you must create a condition. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI > Policies > (create or select policy) > Create alert condition**: You can select APM, Browser, or NRQL condition. 

You must then choose anomaly as your alert condition threshold Type.

This threshold will predict the future behavior for the value of your data. . This prediction  appears as a dotted black line on the preview chart in the anomaly condition UI.

### Configure anomaly thresholds

After you select 'anomaly' for threshold type, you'll need to set your threshold. This will set the criteria that you want to be notified on. 

To do this you'll need to:
* Set whether you want the condition to check for upper violations, lower violations, or both.
* Set the behavior that will trigger an incident (for example: "deviating for more than five minutes") 
* Adjust how sensitive the condition is to fluctuations in the data source by adjusting the sliding bar to more violations or fewer violations. This bar calculates how many standard deviations away from the prediction  you want to be notified.

/>

When your data escapes the predicted "normal" behavior and meets the criteria you've chosen, you'll receive a notification.

Here are some tips for setting anomaly thresholds:

* Set the [anomaly direction](#upper-lower) to monitor violations that happen either above or below the anomaly.
* Set the preview chart to either [2 days or 7 days](#days) of displayed data. (Not applicable for [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries).)
* Use the slider bar to adjust the <img title="Alerts v3: Critical alert icon" alt="icon-alert-critical.png" src={iconAlertCritical}/> **Critical** threshold sensitivity, represented in the preview chart by the light gray area around the anomaly. The tighter the band around the anomaly, the more sensitive it is and the more violations it will generate.
* Optional: You can create a <img title="Alerts v3: Warning alert icon" alt="icon-alert-warning.png" src={iconAlertWarning}/> [**Warning** threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/set-thresholds-alert-condition#threshold-levels) (the darker gray area around the anomaly).
* For NRQL alerts, see the [allowed types of NRQL queries](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries#threshold-types).
* If the alert condition applies to multiple apps, you can select a choice from the dropdown above the chart to use different metrics. (Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions.)

### Faceted anomaly conditions [#anomaly-facets]

Once you've run a faceted NRQL query for a anomaly condition, you can scope your results to a single anomaly.

The single time series shows the anomaly, threshold band, and one or more violation regions, if there are any.

### Anomaly direction: select upper or lower ranges

You can choose whether you want the condition to violate for behavior that goes above the predicted value ("upper") or that goes below the predicted value ("lower"), or that goes either above or below. You choose these with the  prediction direction selector.

Example use cases for this:
* You might use the Upper setting for a data source like error rate, because you generally are only concerned if it goes up, and aren't concerned if it goes down.
* You might use the Lower setting for a data source like throughput, because sudden upward fluctuations are quite common, but a large sudden downswing would be a sign of a problem.

Here are examples of how large fluctuations in your data would be treated under the different anomaly direction settings. The red areas represent violations

### Rules governing calculation of the predicted value

The algorithm for calculating the prediction is mathematically complex. Here are some of the major rules governing its predictive abilities:

* **Age of data** On initial creation, the  prediction is calculated using between 1 to 4 weeks of data, depending on data availability and  prediction type. After its creation, the algorithm will take into account ongoing data fluctuations over a long time period, although greater weight is given to more recent data. For data that has only existed for a short time, the  predicted value will likely fluctuate a good deal and not be very accurate. This is because there is not yet enough data to determine its usual values and behavior. The more history the data has, the more accurate the  prediction and thresholds will become.
* **Consistency of data** For metric values that remain in a consistent range or that trend slowly and steadily, their more predictable behavior means that their thresholds will become tighter around the  prediction. Data that is more varied and unpredictable will have looser (wider) thresholds.
* **Regular fluctuations** For shorter-than-one-week cyclical fluctuations (such as weekly Wednesday 1pm deployments or nightly reports), the  prediction algorithm looks for these cyclical fluctuations and attempts to adjust to them.
