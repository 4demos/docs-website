Learning how to create a simple alert can be a good way to start learning New Relic alerting and applied intelligence features. 

## Create your alert condition from a chart

The easiest way to get started with alerts is to create an alert for a New Relic chart. Note that this route is the same as creating a NRQL alert condition from scratch, but it's just that the chart already has a NRQL query for you to work with.

  <Collapser
    id="collapser-1"
    title="Select your query"

  Let's say you want to create an alert that notifies you of latency issues with web transaction time. First, you would go to the chart labeled **Web transactions time** and click **create and alert condition**.

The condition shows each host's CPU utilization. Use this NRQL query, or something similar that's relevant to what you're monitoring, to create a condition.

  <Collapser
    id="collapser-2"
    title="Name your condition"
  >
  It's important to give your alert condition a specific name. Let's say you name this condition **response time** and then you create another condition for a different application and label that condition **response time** then you won't be able to distinguish which condition is for which application. So, make sure to give your condition a specific and unique name.

Once you've named your condition, then you can make changes to the NRQL query if you'd like. For your first alert, we recommend not adjusting the NRQL query and leaving this section as is but if you'd like to learn more about NRQL visit our (docs)[/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/].

## Set your condition thresholds

Let's say you want to make sure that if web transaction time is longer than usual your team is alerted. In this case, you don't care how much longer web transaction time is, you just want to know if transaction time is behaving abnormally. Our anomaly detection constantly evaluates your data to understand how your system normally behaves. With an anomaly threshold you can use our anomaly detection to alert your team if web transaction time deviates from it's expected performance. Since you only want to know if web transaction time takes _longer_ than usual, you'd select "upper only." For your first alert, we recommend using our default settings and adjusting to your needs as necessary.
