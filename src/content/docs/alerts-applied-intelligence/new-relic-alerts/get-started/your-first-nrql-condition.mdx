Learning how to create a simple alert can be a good way to start learning New Relic alerting and applied intelligence features. 

## Create your alert condition from a chart

The easiest way to get started with alerts is to create an alert for a New Relic chart. Note that this route is the same as creating a NRQL alert condition from scratch, but it's just that the chart already has a NRQL query for you to work with.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="collapser-1"
    title="Select your query"
  >
  Let's say you want to create an alert that notifies you of latency issues with web transaction time. First, you would go to the chart labeled **Web transactions time** and click **create and alert condition**. 

<img
  title="Alert condition from a chart"
  alt="A screenshot depicting how to create an alert condition from a chart"
  src={alertsCreateanAlertConditionFromaChart}
/>
  
  From there, you will see the NRQL queries that built the chart. Select the query that relates to latency issues--in this case, **response time.**

<img
  title="select your query "
  alt="A screenshot demonstrating how to choose your query"
  src={alertsSelectYourQuery}
/>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="collapser-2"
    title="Name your condition"
  >
  It's important to give your alert condition a specific name. Let's say you name this condition **response time** and then you create another condition for a different application and label that condition **response time** then you won't be able to distinguish which condition is for which application. So, make sure to give your condition a specific and unique name. 

  </Collapser>

   <Collapser
    id="collapser-2"
    title="Define your signal"

Once you've named your condition, then you can make changes to the NRQL query if you'd like. For your first alert, we recommend not adjusting the NRQL query and leaving this section as is but if you'd like to learn more about NRQL visit our (docs)[/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/].

## Set your condition thresholds

Once you've defined your signal then you want to set a condition threshold. Let's say you want to make sure that if web transaction time takes longer
