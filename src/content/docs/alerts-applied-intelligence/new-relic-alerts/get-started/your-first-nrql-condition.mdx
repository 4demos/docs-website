Learning how to create a simple alert can be a good way to start learning New Relic alerting and applied intelligence features. 

## Create your alert condition from a chart

The easiest way to get started with alerts is to create an alert for a New Relic chart. Note that this route is the same as creating a NRQL alert condition from scratch, but it's just that the chart already has a NRQL query for you to work with.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="collapser-1"
    title="Select your query"
  >
  Let's say you want to create an alert that notifies you of latency issues with web transaction time. First, you would go to the chart labeled **Web transactions time** and click **create and alert condition**. 

<img
  title="Alert condition from a chart"
  alt="A screenshot depicting how to create an alert condition from a chart"
  src={alertsCreateanAlertConditionFromaChart}
/>
  
  From there, you will see the NRQL queries that built the chart. Select the query that relates to latency issues--in this case, **response time.**

<img
  title="select your query "
  alt="A screenshot demonstrating how to choose your query"
  src={alertsSelectYourQuery}
/>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="collapser-2"
    title="Name your condition"
  >
  It's important to give your alert condition a specific name. Let's say you name this condition **response time** and then you create another condition for a different application and label that condition **response time** then you won't be able to distinguish which condition is for which application. So, make sure to give your condition a specific and unique name.
