DevOps teams have a lot to monitor in increasingly complex systems and it can be hard to keep track of what is going on, where. Notifications are a suite of tools that enable you to get the right information to the right people as soon as possible. Notifications send notification-events to third-party services, such as Slack, Jira, ServiceNow, and email. You can also use webhooks to send your data to any compatible third-party service.
 
You can integrate notifications with your systems by configuring destinations and message templates.
 
From the API perspective, this is the diagram flow: Workflows => Channel id(s) => Destination

## Why are there 3 different configurations? [#configurations]

We have separated configurations to configure a customized notification so we can provide connection details/ to authenticate once(Destination), but create many customized templates for your outgoing events, and connect these with the destination.
 
The Notifications API and configuration objects are product agnostic. Workflows is one of 3 products that use the Notifications API to send notifications events / integrate with third parties, along with [errors Inbox](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/errors-inbox/error-external-services/) and others. Having a unified platform for notifications, you can, for example, set a single Slack or Jira destinations, and use them both in a Workflow and Error-Inbox configuration

## Workflows [#workflows]

In a Workflow you can create filters to decide when the workflow will run, create channels, and add [enrichments](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/custom-variables-incident-workflows/#enrichment-examples). Enrichments are data that will be fetched from NRDB and appear in the outgoing events.

## Message templates (also known as channels) [#message-templates]

Configure the eventual notification events and map New Relic data to your third-party services using a channel, also known as a message template. A channel is a configuration object containing all the information required to send notifications. “Destination” and “Properties” are the main building blocks of a Channel. A Channel enables you to customize your notification event data before it’s sent to your third-party destination.

## Destinations [#destinations]

Destinations are unique identifiers and connection details for third-party notification systems. Use destinations to integrate, send notifications, and share data between New Relic and your third-party systems. A destination contains the location where the notifications will be sent. Destinations are reusable and can be used across New Relic products. 

## API [#api]

You can also use our NerdGraph API to view and configure [destinations](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-api-notifications-destinations) and [notification channels](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-api-notifications-channels).

## Security [#security]

Credentials used for destinations and notification channels are stored securely according to [New Relic security standards](/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/data-encryption).
