Want to monitor your Node.js application with New Relic? You're in the right place. Use this guide to find the best install path to instrument your app with the Node.js agent. 

Still need more information? [Introduction to APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm/) breaks down how application monitoring works and overviews how to use your data. [Introduction to New Relic for Node.js](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/introduction-newrelic-nodejs) walks you through the install process, from beginning to end.

## Choose your install method

We have some options for our install, depending on how your app is deployed.

  To install with a package manager, follow [these steps](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=3501165&state=773dd1ee-a7a0-1450-0a0e-3daf0035c807) in our guided install. This method has you install the agent with `apm` in the command line.

  <Collapser
        id="docker"
        title="Install for apps deployed in Docker containers"
    >
    <Callout variant="tip">
      If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container. 
    </Callout>

    To [install the Node.js agent for Docker](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent-docker/), you'll use the command line to build, configure, and deploy the agent in your Docker app. Make sure you have your license key and what you named your app, as certain steps require them.

    Follow this [non-standard guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=3501165&state=31668b21-7bb1-8d71-01b4-c5de77b3382b) if your app is managed by PM2. This is a manual install via the command line using `curl`, `bash`, and `sudo`.    

    If you use a different process manager (or maybe you don't use one at all), then you'll want to install via our [standard guided install page](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=3501165&state=4475f6ac-b76d-5b68-f00d-16c026bc9b65).

    To install an agent for your AWS Lambda functions, our [self-guided steps](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=3501165&state=c8a6be34-2449-db6e-3e81-dc710a7aae18) provides a setup script that automatically configures AWS for you. 
    
    If you have a preference for manual installation via the command line, we currently have the option for [Legacy instrumentation for Lambda monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-serverless-monitoring-aws-lambda-legacy/#node).
