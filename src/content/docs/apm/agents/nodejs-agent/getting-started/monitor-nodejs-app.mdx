Monitoring for Node.js takes a holistic approach to your app environment. It assumes that requests made to your app can be grouped into transactions. You can give a name to those grouped request paths, which appear in the New Relic UI to help you identify, visualize, and track problem areas in your app environment.

Interested in sending data from your Node.js application to New Relic? You're in the right place. 

Want a more general overview of the install lifecycle from beginning to end? We recommend our [Node.js installation overview](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/introduction-newrelic-nodejs). 

## Choose your Node.js agent install method

  To install with a package manager, follow [these steps](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=3501165&state=773dd1ee-a7a0-1450-0a0e-3daf0035c807) in our guided install. This method has you install the agent with `apm` in the command line.

    Our [Install the Node.js agent for Docker](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent-docker/) doc walks you through installing the agent in the command line. Make sure to grab your app's name and your license key as you situate to start this process.

    Follow our [guided install page](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=3501165&state=31668b21-7bb1-8d71-01b4-c5de77b3382b) to install the agent on an application managed by PM2. This method installs the agent via the command line using `curl`, `bash`, and `sudo`.    

    If you use a different process manager (or maybe you don't use one at all), then you'll want to install via our standard [guided install page](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=3501165&state=4475f6ac-b76d-5b68-f00d-16c026bc9b65).

  <Collapser

    To install an agent for your AWS Lambda functions, our [self-guided steps](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=3501165&state=c8a6be34-2449-db6e-3e81-dc710a7aae18) provides a setup script that automatically configures AWS for you. 
    
    If you have a preference for manual installation via the command line, we currently have the option for [Legacy instrumentation for Lambda monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-serverless-monitoring-aws-lambda-legacy/#node).
