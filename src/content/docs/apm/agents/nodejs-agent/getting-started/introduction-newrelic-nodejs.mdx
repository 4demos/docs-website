Our Node.js agent helps you track and identify problem areas in your app environment, down to tiny errors in your code. After the agent's installed, it'll send data to New Relic, which you can view in the New Relic user interface. 

Ready to send data to New Relic? This doc walks you through installation process, from beginning to end. 

## Overview of installation lifecycle

Once you complete these steps, your app will be instrumented with the Node.js agent.  

1. Make sure your system meets the [Node.js agent compatibility and requirements](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent/).
2. [Sign up for a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) if you haven't yet. (It's free!)
3. If you're ready to start sending data, then we recommend installing via our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=3501165&state=e7659e21-e3bc-1860-fe10-6bc8ba7e8c8d). If you're uncertain about your install path, then pause to read about the different [Node.js install methods](https://docswebsitedevelop-improvenodejs18650.gtsb.io/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/monitor-nodejs-app/#choose-your-nodejs-agent-install-method). We also have a [manual install](#manual-installation) option, if that strikes your fancy.  
4. Generate some traffic on your app, then wait a few minutes. Everything installed correctly if you start seeing data reported in the [APM UI](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/apm-summary-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data/). 

You might want some post-install tasks. You could try [configuring your agent](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration/), or learn about [extending your instrumentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/extend-your-instrumentation/nodejs-custom-instrumentation). Also, we generally recommend that you [keep your agent up to date](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/update-nodejs-agent).     

## Manual installation 

To install the Node.js agent manually: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
        id="step-1"
        title="Step 1: Install the agent"
    >
    Use the command `npm install newrelic --save` for each application you want to monitor. 
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
        id="step-2"
        title="Step 2: Add New Relic to your directory"
    >
    From `node_modules/newrelic`, copy `newrelic.js` into the root directory of your app.
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
        id="step-3"
        title="Step 3: Configure the agent"
    >
    Configure agent via the `newrelic.js` file:

    * Customize the license_key setting with your license key.
    * Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names.

  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
        id="step-4"
        title="Step 4: Add New Relic to the main module."
    >
    Add `require('newrelic');` as the first line of your app's main module. 
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
        id="babel"
        title="Note to Babel users"
    >
      If you are using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/index.html) or a similar transpiler you can safeguard against any issues related to module load order by utilizing the [Node command line option '-r'](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#-r---require-module) to preload the 'newrelic' module at application startup. For example, if your application's entry point is `./dist/server.js` then you would use the require flag like so:

      ```
      node -r newrelic ./dist/server.js
      ```
      If you are unable to `require('newrelic');` as the first line of your app's main module and you are unable to use the require flag as above (e.g. asynchronously loading api keys from a remote location during application bootstrapping), you may also add stock instrumentation to an already loaded [supported module](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/blob/0113eb5f0e707dc662a17d262a841503bab88841/lib/instrumentations.js#L6#L6) by using [`newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule`](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/api-guides/nodejs-agent-api/#instrumentLoadedModule):
      
      ```js
      // module loaded before newrelic 
      const expressModule = require('express');
      
      // load the agent
      const newrelic = require('newrelic');

      // instrument express after the agent has been loaded
      newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(
        'express',    // the module's name, as a string
        expressModule // the module instance
      );
      ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup> 

## View logs for your APM and infrastructure data

You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With [logs in context](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-nodejs/), you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page.

## Troubleshoot your installation

If something behaves unexpectedly, then take a look at our [Troubleshoot your Node.js installation](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-your-nodejs-installation/) doc. We also recommend this [forum post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/node-js-troubleshooting-framework-install/108682) from our Explorers Hub about troubleshooting the Node.js agent install.

If you encounter issues with your Node.js agent, see our troubleshooting docs. Some of the most important troubleshooting docs in that section include: 

* [Large memory usage](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-large-memory-usage-nodejs): If you've installed the Node.js agent and your memory usage has increased, check out these possible solutions.
* [Troubleshooting browser instrumentation](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-browser-instrumentation-nodejs): If you encounter problems with browser data, see these additional tips for Node.js.

If you need more help, get support at support.newrelic.com.

## Check the source code

Our Node.js agent is open source software. You can [browse the source code](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic) and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the [node-newrelic README on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/blob/main/README.md).
