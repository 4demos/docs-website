Our [PHP agent](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/new-relic-php) auto-instruments your code so you can identify and solve performance issues. With performance monitoring, you can collect and analyze business data to improve customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. 

## PHP agent in context

Our PHP agent consists of two basic components:

* A PHP extension, which collects data from your application
* A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic

    src={phpAgentDiagram5}
/>

The workflow between your application and New Relic looks something like this:

1. The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data.
2. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called [agent mode](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/starting-php-daemon-advanced/) and is the default.

To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established.

## Installation overview

To get your PHP agent up and running:

1. [Sign up](https://newrelic.com/signup) for a New Relic account.
2. Check that your system meets the [PHP agent's compatibility and requirements](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements).
3. Copy your [license key](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements/#license_key) information from your **Account settings**.
4. Choose your [installation path](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/monitor-your-php-app#how-are-you-installing). You can either install manually, or use our [guided installation](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=77dbbc75-af0f-07d8-9a02-fa987652f347). 
5. Once installed, [give your application a name](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application/).
6. Restart your web server.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you are [installing the agent on a shared hosting service](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/install-php-agent-shared-hosting-service), ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance.
</Callout>

To make sure your PHP agent is initiated, mess around on your app to generate some data. After, check your app's performance from our APM summary page. To view that page, navigate to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=e31a9317-206f-3e91-784e-da6ad2876ec7), click **APM** in the horizontal **Explorer** nav, then select your app.  

Want to configure your agent? Look at the [configuration options](/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration) to further customize and fine-tune your installation. 

## Monitor app performance

Our PHP agent gives you a bird's eye view of your application's performance.

## Additional instrumentation

After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation:

* [Page load timing](/docs/agents/php-agent/features/page-load-timing-php): Integrate the PHP agent with [browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/new-relic-browser) to gain visibility into end-user activity.
* [Custom instrumentation](/docs/agents/php-agent/features/php-custom-instrumentation): Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation.
* [Agent API](/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-api): Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely.
* [Agent attributes](/docs/agents/php-agent/attributes/php-agent-attributes): Customize the [attributes](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-metrics/agent-attributes) attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions.

## Troubleshooting procedures

If you're having problems, see the PHP agent troubleshooting docs. Some of the most important troubleshooting docs in that section include:	

* [No data appears (PHP)](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-php)	
* [Determining permissions requirements](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/determining-permissions-requirements)	
* [INI settings not taking effect immediately](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/ini-settings-not-taking-effect-immediately)	
* [Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/why-when-restart-your-web-server-php)
