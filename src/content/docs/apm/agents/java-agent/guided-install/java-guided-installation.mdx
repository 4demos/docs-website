metaDescription: Here are some tips for managing your APM Java agent following the guided installation.
---

If you are wondering how to manage your Java agent after using our CLI-based guided installation, you're in the right place. Because you used the CLI, the management tasks you can do with the agent after installation are somewhat different than if you had installed the agent manually. The goal of the CLI approach was to give you a quick view of what the Java agent can do for you, so it instrumented your apps in a streamlined way. As a result, you have a different set of options for managing this streamlined agent.


## What's happening under the hood with this CLI installation [#overview]

When you installed the APM Java agent using the CLI, it installed the [New Relic infrastructure monitoring agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent/) as a foundation for the Java agent. [I AM MAKING THIS UP]. Along with the infrastructure agent, you also received a companion program called the Java process detection integration. These work in tandem to check to for Java applications on your host.

### Rename an application [#rename]

To rename a New Relic application you created:

1. Re-run the guided installation.
2. When you are prompted, enter a new application name.
3. Restart any previously-instrumented applications to start sending telemetry data using the new application name.

## Update the Java agent [#update]

To update to the latest Java agent:

1. Re-run the guided installation, which downloads the latest Java APM agent to your host.
2. Restart your previously-instrumented applications to start sending telemetry data using the latest Java agent.


## Disable the Java agent [#disable]

If you ever need to disable the Java agent, but not remove it, you can disable its companion program called the Java process detection integration:

1. Remove the configuration file (`/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/java-dynamic-attach.yml`).
2. Restart the infrastructure service. [HOW DO YOU DO THIS?]

## Uninstall the Java agent [#uninstall]

To remove the Java agent from a host, including the companion program Java process integration:

1. Delete the following directories and files:

    * `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/java-dynamic-attach.yml`
    * `/etc/newrelic-java/`

2. Remove the following package: `sudo apt remove nri-introspector-java`

## Stop reporting telemetry data

To ensure that you are no longer reporting telemetry data after you disable or remove the Java agent, restart the previously-instrumented application server to stop reporting data to New Relic.
