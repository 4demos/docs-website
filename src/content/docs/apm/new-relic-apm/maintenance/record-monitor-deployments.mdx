Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts.

See how deployment markers work in this short video (4:30 minutes):
<Video id="HPeXZubcZ7o" type="youtube"/>

## Options for tracking deployments [#options]

You can use the New Relic [REST API v2](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/new-relic-rest-api-v2-getting-started) to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically.

You can use your [Slack](https://slack.com/) integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel.

There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can **view** deployments in the UI:

* In the activity feed of the [APM Summary](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data), **Service** summary, and [entity summary](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts) pages.
* On APM performance charts as a chart marker.
* On the [**Deployments** page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/deployments-page-view-impact-your-app-users) for summary performance.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Deployment markers are not available for browser applications, but see [browser releases](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-release) for a way to tag errors with release versions.
</Callout>

## Record deployments with the REST API [#api-instructions]

You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments.

* The examples in this document use `curl` as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the [API Explorer](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_deployments/create).
* JSON uses double quotes `"` for element names and content. Using single quotes `'` will cause errors.

    title="Record a deployment with POST"
  >
    To record a new deployment, send a `POST` request that includes your [API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key) to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see [Character limits and JSON parameters](#deployment_limits)). All payload parameters are optional except `revision`.

    For example:

    ```
    curl -X POST "https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/<var><a href="/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/finding-product-id#apm">$APP_ID</a></var>/deployments.json" \
         -H "Api-Key:<a href="/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key"><var>$API_KEY</var></a>" \
         -i \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d \
    '{
      "deployment": {
        "revision": "<var>REVISION</var>",
        "changelog": "<var>Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None</var>",

    To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a `POST` request that includes your [API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key) to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see [Character limits and JSON parameters](#deployment_limits)). All payload parameters are optional except `revision`.

    This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher:

    ```
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/<var><a href="/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/finding-product-id#apm">YOUR_APP_ID</a></var>/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='<a href="/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key"><var>$API_KEY</var></a>'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{
        "deployment": {
        "revision": "<var>REVISION</var>",
        "changelog": "<var>Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None</var>",
        "description": "<var>Added a deployments resource to the v2 API</var>",
        "user": "<var>datanerd@example.com</var>",
        "timestamp": "<var>2019-10-08T00:15:36Z</var>"
    }
    }'
    ```

    This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher):

    ```
    $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding("ASCII")
    $data ='{
    "deployment": {
        "revision": "<var>REVISION</var>",

    To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a `GET` request that includes your [API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key) to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload.

    For example:

    ```
    curl -X GET "https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/<var><a href="/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/finding-product-id#apm">$APP_ID</a></var>/deployments.json" \

## Record deployments using the New Relic agent [#agent]

Some agents have additional methods to record deployments:

* **All agents**: Use the New Relic [REST API v2](#api).
* **C**: No SDK-specific methods. Use the [REST API](#api).
* **Go**: No agent-specific methods. Use the [REST API](#api).
* **Java**: Call the [Java agent `jar`](/docs/agents/java-agent/instrumentation/recording-deployments-java-agent).
* **.NET**: Use [PowerShell and the REST API](#powershell).
* **Node.js**: No agent-specific methods. Use the [REST API](#api).
* **PHP**: Use a [PHP script](/docs/agents/php-agent/features/recording-deployments-using-php-script).
* **Python**: Use the [`record-deploy`](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-admin-script#record-deploy) subcommand of the `newrelic-admin` script.
* **Ruby**: Use a [Capistrano recipe](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/features/recording-deployments-ruby-agent#capistrano3).

## Notify your team of deployments [#webhooks]

After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment.

The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel:

1. Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to **App directory > Manage > Apps**.
2. Search for your New Relic app, then select **Add configuration**.
3. From **Post to channel**, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then **Add configuration**.
4. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL.
5. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > ([account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown)) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook**.
6. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save.
7. Optional: Send a test message.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for [alert notifications](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts).
</Callout>

## Where to view your deployments in the UI [#view-markers]

Once you've recorded a deployment, you can see it contextualized by data from across your stack in a number of ways:

* **Charts in APM and dashboards:** A vertical line with a pinhead appears on time series charts. This “marker” represents the recorded deployment event, and if you click on the pinhead you can start drilling into the impact the change had on Entity health and quality (more on this in a bit).
    <Callout variant="tip">
      If you land on a Dashboard or Entity Summary page and don't see the deployment marker you're expecting, check your time picker selection. It might be outside the window you are looking at.
    </Callout>
    <img
      title="A screenshot showing a deployment in a time series chart"
      alt="A screenshot showing a deployment in a time series chart"
      src={timeSeriesChart}
    />
* **Entity sidebar:** On the sidebar for any entity with recorded deployments, you can click on **Deployments** to see a table displaying recorded deployment events. This opens the deployments list page, which contains a table you can use to filter and sort results. This can help you find specific deployment&#8212;especially if you have a large number of deployments).
    <img
      title="A screenshot showing the navigation in the sidebar"
      alt="A screenshot showing the navigation in the sidebar"
      src={leftNavDeployments}
    />
* **New Relic Alerts & Detection:** If your deployment is related to an issue, you'll see it listed on the Deployments table of the **Root Cause Analysis** section of the **Issues** page.
    <img
      title="A screenshot showing the root cause analysis page in the UI"
      alt="A screenshot showing the root cause analysis page in the UI"
      src={rootCauseAnalysis}
    />
* **Activity stream newsfeed component:** You can see recorded deployment events in the right pane on various pages across the New Relic UI.
    <img
      title="A screenshot showing the activity stream in the right pane of the UI"
      alt="A screenshot showing the activity stream in the right pane of the UI"
      src={activityStream}
    />

## Analyze the impact of your deployment [#impact]

How have your deployments affected your sytems? We offer a number of ways to analyze the effects of your deployments.

### Deployment details page [#deployment-details]

Clicking on a deployment virtually anywhere in New Relic&#8212;on a chart, on the Issues page, and so on#8212;will open a **Deployment details** page containing the data you sent when you recorded the deployment event, along with various insights into the impact this deployment may have had on an Entity's health, performance, and quality.

Here are some insights you can get from the UI:

* Understand the net impact of this change over time with our time series charts for key entity signals (New Relic's Golden Signals [INSERT LINKS HERE]. These charts display a marker drawn down the middle and a calculated delta to show changes over time.
* Faceted findings from a variety of New Relic products including errors inbox, log monitoring, AIOps (issues, incidents, and anomalies) that show how this deployment has affected or relates to crucial troubleshooting and analysis records.
* Links to entities related to this deployment's entity. This helps you move across your stack as you look for the source of a problem or measure the impact of changes stemming from this deployment.

### Changing the before/after comparison window [#change-window]

The **Deployment details** page hinges on the idea that records and signals generated over a period of time leading up to this deployment are being compared to a period of equal length following this deployment. You can change the length of that period using a time picker in the top-right corner.

### Comparing one deployment to another [#compare-deployments]

Next to the time picker in the top-right corner, you will see **compared to** next to a dropdown menu. Using that dropdown menu, you can select another recorded deployment. This will toggle the **Deployment marker details** page to a comparative mode.

When you compare deployments:

* Each time series chart will show a curve for THIS deployment and THAT deployment, which will help you compare the relative performance of each deployment.
* Other calculations on this page will update to help you understand the difference between THIS deployment and THAT deployment.

## Querying Deployments Data [#query-deployments]

You can also query deployments data via NerdGraph (New Relic's GraphQL API) or NRQL (the query language for the New Relic database). For more details, see [Introduction to New Relic NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/) and [Introduction to NRQL](docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/).

### NRQL [#nrql-markers]

Here's a simple NRQL query to get you started. You can run this from our [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder):

```sql
SELECT * FROM Deployment SINCE 30 days AGO
```

### NerdGraph (GraphQL) [#graphql-markers]

Here's an example NerdGraph query you can run in our [NerdGraph explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer#find):

```graphql
{
  actor {
    entity(guid: "EXAMPLE") {
      name
      guid
      deploymentSearch(filter: {timeWindow: {endTime: 1664625540000, startTime: 1664516940000}}) {
        results {
          version
          user
          timestamp
          description
          deploymentType
          deploymentId
          groupId
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
