The APM **Transactions** page helps you identify transactions you can look at more closely to troubleshoot performance problems and avoid errors. 

<Callout variant="tip">
  At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. For more information about transactions in the context of APM, see [Transactions in New Relic's APM](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm/). 
</Callout>

## Transactions page basics

To get the most out of this area of the UI, first get oriented to the basics. 

The overview bar at the top of the **Transactions** page highlights key performants metrics, including the most time consuming transaction, the highest average response time in seconds, the most dissatisfying [apdex score](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measure-user-satisfaction), the highest error rate, and the highest [throughput](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#throughput) (requests per minute, or RPM). 

The central chart on the **Transactions** page graphs the top five transactions by wall-clock time and visually orders transactions according to how much time they take to complete. The page also shows relevant throughputs. You can also use the buttons at the top of the chart to toggle betwee this view, a web transactions histogram, and a web transactions percentile line graph.  

### Wall clock time [#wall_clock_time]
Wall clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wallclock time for all transactions and then calculates that value across all transactions.
  
Note that the host can execute requests in parallel, with each counted separately in wall-clock time, so you may see percentages over 100.
</Callout>

The longer a given transaction takes, and the more time it takes compared to other transactions, the more likely it is that it's a source of issues for a given app. Similarly, low throughput can be an indicator that not everything is working as it should. 

We recommend you make a habit of reviewing this app performance data more closely in order to scan for new issues and diagnose the cause of problems you're already aware of. 

### Web versus Non-web transactions [#web-nonweb]

Depending on your selected application, the **Transactions** page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the [types of transactions available](#txn-type-dropdown). New Relic measures [processing time](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/request-queuing-tracking-front-end-time) by type of request ([web transaction](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#transaction) or [non-web transaction](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#non-web-transaction)). This may include:

* **Web:** App server requests
* **Non-web:** Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.)

## Things to do from the Transactions page: basic functions [#basic-functions]

Follow these steps to view basic information about your app transaction requests.

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions**.
2. Change which available types of transactions appear using the **Transaction type** toggle.
3. Select the **Sort by** order or keep the default.
4. Select the [type of view](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/select-chart-views) as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available.

## Things to do from the Transactions page: deeper exploration [#deep-exploration]

There are also also several drill-down options and additional layers of detail for you to explore. You can:

* View additional details with any of the transaction [drill-down functions](#drilldown)
* Display a detailed transactions table by clicking **See transactions table**. 
* View detailed information for individual transaction traces by clicking the transaction name in the **Transaction traces** table
* Click the **Instances** toggle to refine and sort your data.
* Add charts to a dashboards: mouse over a chart, then click the **Add to a dashboard** link that appears

<Callout variant="tip">
  If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's [**Critical** threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/define-thresholds-trigger-alert) has been violated. To view the [incident details](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/reviewing-alert-incidents/view-violation-event-details-incidents) in [New Relic Alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-alerts), click the chart.

### Use drill-down functions to monitor different kinds of performance [#drilldown]

In addition to New Relic's standard [user interface functions](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/standard-page-functions), there are additional drill-down functions unique to the **Transactions** page. Here are the details on those functions and the data each provides. 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="txn-type-dropdown"
    title="Change the displayed transaction Type"
  >
    If the **Type** dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="sort-definitions"
    title="Select the type of performance measurement (Sort)"
  >
    The **Sort by** dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to the following measurements.

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            **Sort option**
          </th>

          <th>
            **Comments**
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Most time consuming (default)
          </td>

          <td>
            Highest percentage of the app's total time used.

            This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Slowest average response time
          </td>

          <td>
            Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged.

            This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Apdex most dissatisfying
          </td>

          <td>
            Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services ([Apdex](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction)).

            The [dissatisfaction level](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/view-your-apdex-score#apdex-dissat) is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's `apdex_t` ("tolerating") score, based on your [Apdex settings](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/change-your-apdex-settings). Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Highest throughput
          </td>

          <td>
            This measures the amount of [throughput](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#throughput), in operation requests per minute or **rpm**. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or **ppm**.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking.

    The **Transaction** page's **Top web transactions** and **Top non-web transactions** charts, as well the **App performance** window for a selected transaction include options to view data as a [chart](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/select-chart-views), [histogram](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/histograms-view-data-distribution), or [percentile](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/percentiles-compare-ranked-data).

    In a transaction's **Breakdown table**, the **Avg Calls/Txn** column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds.

    * <Icon

        name="fe-square"
      />
      Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10.
    * <Icon
