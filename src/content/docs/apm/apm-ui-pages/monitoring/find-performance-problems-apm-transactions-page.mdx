The APM **Transactions** page helps you identify transactions you can look at more closely to troubleshoot performance problems and avoid errors. 

<Callout variant="tip">
  At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. For more information about transactions in the context of APM, see [Transactions in New Relic's APM](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm/). 
</Callout>

## Transactions page basics

To get the most out of this area of the UI, first get oriented to the basics. 

The transactions page lists the selected app's transaction requests and graphs the top five transactions by [wall-clock time](#wall_clock_time) to visually order transactions according to how much time they take to complete. The page also shows relevant [throughputs](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#throughput) (requests per minute, or RPM). 

<Callout variant="tip">
  Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all transactions and then calculates that value across all transactions.
  
  Note that the host can execute requests in parallel, with each counted separately in wall-clock time, so you may see percentages over 100.
</Callout>

The longer a given transaction takes, and the more time it takes compared to other transactions, the more likely it is that it's a source of ineficiency or latency for a given app. Similarly, low throughput can be an indicator that not everything is working as it should. 

We recommend you make a habit of reviewing this app performance data more closely in order to scan for new issues and diagnose the cause of problems you're already aware of. 

### Types of transactions

<!-- check the info in the para below -->

Depending on your selected application, the **Transactions** page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the [types of transactions available](#txn-type-dropdown). New Relic measures [processing time](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/request-queuing-tracking-front-end-time) by type of request ([web transaction](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#transaction) or [non-web transaction](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#non-web-transaction)). This may include:

* **Web:** App server requests
* **Non-web:** Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.)

## Use the transaction page to view basic information

Follow these steps to view basic information about your app's transaction requests.

<!-- CHECK THAT EACH STEP CAN BE DONE IN NEW UI -->

1. Do one of the following:
   * Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions**.
   * Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions**.
2. If applicable: To change which available [types](#tx_types) of transactions appear, select the **Type**.
3. Select the [sort order](#sort-definitions), or keep the default.
4. Select the [type of view](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/select-chart-views) as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available.
5. To view additional details, use any of the transaction [drill-down functions](#tx_functions).
6. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the **Add to a dashboard** link that appears below it.

If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's [**Critical** threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/define-thresholds-trigger-alert) has been violated. To view the [incident details](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/reviewing-alert-incidents/view-violation-event-details-incidents) in [New Relic Alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-alerts), click the chart.

## Use drill-down functions to monitor different kinds of performance [#tx_functions]

You can use any of New Relic's standard [user interface functions](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/standard-page-functions) to drill down into detailed information. There are also additional drill-down functions unique to the **Transactions** page. Here are the details on those functions and the data each provides.

    title="Change the displayed transaction Type"
  >
    ![Screenshot showing the dropdown that allows you to choose other transaction types.](./images/trx-type-dropdown.png "trx-type-dropdown.png")

    If the **Type** dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="sort-definitions"
    title="Select the type of performance measurement (Sort)"

    The **Sort** dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to the following measurements.

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>

          </td>

          <td>
            Highest percentage of the app's total time used.

            This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Slowest average response time
          </td>

          <td>
            Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged.

            This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking.
          </td>

            Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services ([Apdex](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction)).

            The [dissatisfaction level](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/view-your-apdex-score#apdex-dissat) is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's `apdex_t` ("tolerating") score, based on your [Apdex settings](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/change-your-apdex-settings). Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking.

            This measures the amount of [throughput](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#throughput), in operation requests per minute or **rpm**. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or **ppm**.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking.
