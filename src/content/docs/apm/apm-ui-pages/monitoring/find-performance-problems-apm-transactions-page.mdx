The APM **Transactions** page helps you identify transactions you can look at more closely to troubleshoot performance problems and avoid errors. 

<Callout variant="tip">
  At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. For more information about transactions in the context of APM, see [Transactions in New Relic's APM](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm/). 
</Callout>

## Transactions page overview

Access the APM **Transactions** page by going to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions**. 

![Screenshot showing ransactions page default view](./images/APM-transactions-page-default-view.jpg "Transactions page default view")

The overview bar at the top of the **Transactions** page highlights key performants metrics, including the most time consuming transaction, the highest average response time in seconds, the most dissatisfying [apdex score](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measure-user-satisfaction), the highest error rate, and the highest [throughput](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#throughput) (calls per minute). 

The central chart on the **Transactions** page graphs the top five transactions by wall-clock time and visually orders transactions according to how much time they take to complete. The page also shows relevant throughputs. You can also use the buttons at the top of the chart to toggle betwee this view, a web transactions histogram, and a web transactions percentile line graph. 

In general, the longer a given transaction takes, and the more time it takes compared to other transactions, the more likely it is that it's a source of issues for a given app. Similarly, low throughput can be an indicator that not everything is working as it should. 

We recommend you make a habit of reviewing app performance data on the APM **Transactions** page more closely in order to scan for new issues and diagnose the cause of problems you're already aware of.

### Wall clock time [#wall_clock_time]
Wall clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wallclock time for all transactions and then calculates that value across all transactions.
  
Note that the host can execute requests in parallel, with each counted separately in wall-clock time, so you may see percentages over 100.
</Callout> 

### Web versus Non-web transactions [#web-nonweb]

Depending on your selected application, the **Transactions** page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the [types of transactions available](#txn-type-dropdown). New Relic measures [processing time](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/request-queuing-tracking-front-end-time) by type of request ([web transaction](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#transaction) or [non-web transaction](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#non-web-transaction)). This may include:

* **Web:** App server requests
* **Non-web:** Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.)

## Use drill-down functions to monitor different kinds of performance [#drilldown]

In addition to New Relic's standard [user interface functions](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/standard-page-functions), the **Transactions** page offers several unique drill-down options and additional layers of detail by transaction and chart. 

<Callout variant="tip">
  If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's [**Critical** threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/define-thresholds-trigger-alert) has been violated. To view the [incident details](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/reviewing-alert-incidents/view-violation-event-details-incidents) in [New Relic Alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-alerts), click the chart.

    The **Sort by** dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to the following measurements.

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            **Sort option**

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Most time consuming (default)
          </td>

          <td>
            Highest percentage of the app's total time used.

            This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Slowest average response time
          </td>

          <td>
            Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged.

            This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking.

            Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services ([Apdex](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction)).

            The [dissatisfaction level](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/view-your-apdex-score#apdex-dissat) is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's `apdex_t` ("tolerating") score, based on your [Apdex settings](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/change-your-apdex-settings). Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking.

            This measures the amount of [throughput](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#throughput), in operation requests per minute or **rpm**. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or **ppm**.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking.
