The APM **Transactions** page helps you identify transactions to look at more closely in order to troubleshoot performance problems and avoid errors. 

In general, the longer a given transaction takes, and the more time it takes compared to other transactions, the more likely it is that it's a source of issues for a given app. Similarly, low throughput can be an indicator that not everything is working as it should. 

We recommend you make a habit of reviewing app performance data on the APM **Transactions** page more closely in order to scan for new issues and diagnose the cause of problems you're already aware of.

<Callout variant="tip">
  At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. For more information about transactions in the context of APM, see [Transactions in New Relic's APM](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm/). 
</Callout>

## Transactions page overview

Access the APM **Transactions** page by going to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions**. 

![Screenshot showing ransactions page default view](./images/APM-transactions-page-default-view.jpg "Transactions page default view")

Find key performance metrics in the overview bar at the top of the **Transactions**. In the main chart, view the top five transactions by wall-clock time, visually arranged  according to how much time they took to complete. There's also clickable list of the top 20 transactions, a throughput graph, and a table of transaction traces. 

### Wall clock time [#wall_clock_time]
Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. For APM transactions data, New Relic uses wall-clock time for all transactions and then calculates that value across all transactions.
  
Note that the host can execute requests in parallel, with each counted separately in wall-clock time, so you may see percentages over 100.

### Web versus Non-web transactions [#web-nonweb]

Depending on your selected application, the **Transactions** page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the **Transaction type** dropdown. New Relic measures [processing time](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/request-queuing-tracking-front-end-time) by type of request ([web transactions (app server requests)](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#transaction) or [non-web transactions (all other requests, such as operations, background tasks, and similar)](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#non-web-transaction)).

## Use drill-down functions to monitor different kinds of performance [#drilldown]

In addition to New Relic's standard [user interface functions](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/standard-page-functions), the **Transactions** page offers several unique drill-down options and additional layers of detail by transaction and chart. 

<Callout variant="tip">
  If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's [**Critical** threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/define-thresholds-trigger-alert) has been violated. To view the [incident details](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/reviewing-alert-incidents/view-violation-event-details-incidents) in [New Relic Alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-alerts), click the chart.

    The **Sort by** dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to the following measurements.

          <td>
            Most time consuming (default)
          </td>

          <td>
            The transactions that consume the most total time. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. In other words, a short transaction called a large number of times or a long transaction called just a few times could both appear at the top of this ranking.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Slowest average response time
          </td>

          <td>
            The slowest transactions to complete. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking.

          <td>
            Apdex most dissatisfying

            The transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services ([Apdex](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction)).

            The [dissatisfaction level](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/view-your-apdex-score#apdex-dissat) is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's Apdex score, based on your [Apdex settings](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/change-your-apdex-settings). Transactions that have the lowest (worst) Apdex scores appear at the top of this ranking.
