APM's **Deployments** page lists recent deployments and their impact on your end user and app server's Apdex scores, response times, throughput, and errors. You can view and drill down details, use search and sort options, hide or delete the error, share it with others, or file a ticket about it.


<Callout variant="important">
  If you see a banner in the UI similar to the one below, follow the instructions here for using the new public preview UI. If you don't see this banner, check out these [deployment marker UI instructions](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/events/change-tracking/record-deployments#dep_procedures).
    <img

Once you've completed the [steps](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/events/change-tracking/record-deployments) for recording a deployment, you are ready to see its performance in the UI. You can see the results contextualized by data from across your stack in a number of ways:

* **Charts in APM and dashboards:** A vertical line with a pinhead appears on time series charts. This marker represents the recorded deployment event, and if you click on the pinhead, you can start drilling into the impact the change had on entity health and quality.
    <img
      title="A screenshot showing a deployment in a time series chart"
      alt="A screenshot showing a deployment in a time series chart"
      src={trackingDeploymentinTimeseriesChart}
    />
    <Callout variant="tip">
      If you land on a dashboard or entity summary page and don't see the deployment marker you're expecting, check your time picker selection. It might be outside the window you are looking at.
    </Callout>
* **Entity sidebar:** On the sidebar for any entity with recorded deployments, you can click on **Deployments** to see a table displaying recorded deployment events. This opens the deployments list page, which contains a table you can use to filter and sort results. This can help you find specific deployment&#8212;especially if you have a large number of deployments).
    <img
      title="A screenshot showing the navigation in the sidebar"
      alt="A screenshot showing the navigation in the sidebar"
      src={trackingLeftNavigation}
    />
* **New Relic Alerts & Detection:** If your deployment is related to an issue, you'll see it listed on the Deployments table of the **Root Cause Analysis** section of the **Issues** page.
    <img
      title="A screenshot showing the root cause analysis page in the UI"
      alt="A screenshot showing the root cause analysis page in the user interface"
      src={trackingRootCauseAnalysis}
    />
* **Activity stream newsfeed component:** You can see recorded deployment events in the right pane on various pages across the New Relic UI.
    <img
      title="A screenshot showing the activity stream in the right pane of the UI"
      alt="A screenshot showing the activity stream in the right pane of the UI"

## New UI: Analyze the impact of your deployment [#impact]

How have your deployments affected your sytems? We offer a number of ways to analyze the effects of your deployments.

### Deployment details page [#deployment-details]

Clicking on a deployment virtually anywhere in New Relic&#8212;on a chart, on the **Issues** page, and so on&#8212;will open a **Deployment details** page containing the data you sent when you recorded the deployment event. You'll also get various insights into the impact this deployment may have had on an entity's health, performance, and quality.

    <img
      title="A screenshot showing and example of the deployment details page"
      alt="A screenshot showing and example of the deployment details page"
      src={trackingDeploymentDetails}
    />

Here are some insights you can get from the UI:

* Understand the net impact of this change over time with our time series charts for key entity signals [New Relic's Golden Signals](https://newrelic.com/blog/best-practices/monitoring-golden-signals). These charts display a marker drawn down the middle and a calculated delta to show changes over time.
* Faceted findings from a variety of New Relic products including errors inbox, log monitoring, AIOps (issues, incidents, and anomalies) that show how this deployment has affected or relates to crucial troubleshooting and analysis records.

    <img
      title="A screenshot showing some faceted findings since your deployment"
      alt="A screenshot showing some faceted findings since your deployment"
      src={trackingFacetedFindings}
    />
* Links to entities related to this deployment's entity. This helps you move across your stack as you look for the source of a problem or measure the impact of changes stemming from this deployment.

### Change the before/after comparison window [#change-window]

The **Deployment details** page hinges on the idea that records and signals generated over a period of time leading up to this deployment are being compared to a period of equal length following this deployment. You can change the length of that period using a time picker in the top-right corner.

    <img
      title="A screenshot showing how to change the time window for the comparison"
      alt="A screenshot showing how to change the time window for the comparison"
      src={trackingComparisonWindow}
    />

### Compare one deployment to another [#compare-deployments]

Next to the time picker in the top-right corner, you will see **compared to** next to a dropdown menu. Using that dropdown menu, you can select another recorded deployment. This will toggle the **Deployment marker details** page to a comparative mode.

    <img
      title="A screenshot showing how to compare one deployment with another"
      alt="A screenshot showing how to compare one deployment with another"
      src={trackingCompareDeployments}
    />

When you compare deployments:

* Each time series chart will show a curve for THIS deployment and THAT deployment, which will help you compare the relative performance of each deployment.
* Other calculations on this page will update to help you understand the difference between THIS deployment and THAT deployment.

## New UI: Query deployments data [#query-deployments]

You can also query deployments data via NerdGraph (New Relic's GraphQL API) or NRQL (the query language for the New Relic database). For more details, see [Introduction to New Relic NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/) and [Introduction to NRQL](docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/).

### NRQL [#nrql-markers]

Here is a simple NRQL query to get you started. You can run this from our [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder):

```sql
SELECT * FROM Deployment SINCE 30 days AGO
```

### NerdGraph (GraphQL) [#graphql-markers]

Here is an example NerdGraph query you can run in our [NerdGraph explorer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/nerdgraph-explorer#find):

```graphql
{
  actor {
    entity(guid: "EXAMPLE") {
      name
      guid
      deploymentSearch(filter: {timeWindow: {endTime: 1664625540000, startTime: 1664516940000}}) {
        results {
          version
          user
          timestamp
          description
          deploymentType
          deploymentId
          groupId
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
