Review and manage how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB) on the **Data retention** page. This page helps you understand the sources of data that you’re storing, when they were last updated, and the length the data is stored. Retention settings range from 8 to 395 days depending on the data's `source` and `namespace` classifications in New Relic.

  From the Data retention page, which shows the source of data, you can click Edit settings to adjust the data retention for each source.

## Adjusting retention values

You can adjust your retention periods to better support your data needs. You might reduce your contracted retention values to optimize query performance. Conversely, you might increase retention for some data types to support more granular analysis over longer periods of time, or to meet data compliance requirements.  

The ability to edit data retention periods differs depending on your [edition of New Relic](https://newrelic.com/pricing):

* Standard edition: your data retention is fixed, and falls between 8 and 395 days (about 13 months) of retention, depending on which capabilities of the New Relic platform you’re using. The prescribed retention levels ensure that you can explore your data and experience the value of New Relic. If you need to raise some of the retention limits for your particular business needs, you can purchase additional retention.
* Pro or Enterprise: If after you finalize your contracted retention you realize you need to make changes, you can adjust your telemetry data retention settings yourself.

### Reducing retention values

When you reduce the number of days that specific data sources are retained, existing data of that source type won't immediately disappear and might be visible and returned in queries for up to several weeks. We have safeguards in place to ensure you don't accidentally delete data, but this also means that reducing retention values isn't a good strategy for quickly [removing data](#data-deletion).

That said, your change is registered in the system within 12 hours and new data of the adjusted source type will be retained for the new duration. 

Note that reducing data retention below your contracted retention values will not reduce New Relic’s data ingest charges. Conversely, increasing retention for targeted telemetry data types is likely to trigger a conversation with New Relic about adjusting your data ingest charges.

## Retention periods [#adjust-retention]

The following table shows the default retention settings for our [New Relic One pricing plan](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing). To adjust retention settings, you must be on a [Pro or Enterprise](https://newrelic.com/pricing) tier.

## Metric data rollup

[Metric timeslice data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#timeslice-data) is generated by APM (both custom metrics and out-of-the-box metrics), mobile, and browser agents. Metric timeslice data is aggregated first to 1-minute rollups retained for 8 days, then aggregated to 1-hour roll-ups for 90 days, with key metric data in turn being stored indefinitely. We meter on the size of the initial 1-minute rollup, not on any of the subsequent rollups. Read on to learn the key metrics by product.

### Key metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile

Here are the key metrics that are stored indefinitely.

### Raw metric data

Raw metric data, from APM, Prometheus remote-write API, metrics functionality of the Telemetry SDK, and integrations built on the Telemetry SDK, is handled a little differently. Raw sub-minute metric data is stored for 30 days. Beyond 30 days, 1-minute resolution roll-up events are created and retained for 13 months. As with Metric timeslice data, we meter and bill on the size of the raw ingest, not the subsequent rollups.

Metric retention periods are not editable.

## Account inheritance [#account-structure]

For organizations that have a [parent/child account structure](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/mastersub-account-structure), data retention is inherited by a parent account's child accounts. If a child account has its own data retention settings, those override settings inherited from the parent account.

## Copy retention values

If you have permission to edit retention settings, you can also copy retention values from one child account to other child accounts under the same parent account. To do this, from within a child account, select the **Copy settings to other accounts** link, and then select the child accounts you want to apply the retention values to.

![image of child accounts to copy retention values to](./images/copy-data-retention.png "Copy retention values")

<figcaption>
  Select the child accounts you want to copy retention values to.
</figcaption>

## Data deletion

Once [telemetry data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types) (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its [data retention period](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/manage-data-retention/#adjust-retention) ends. If you need to delete data, contact your New Relic account representative. 

## Original pricing plan differences [#original-pricing]

If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you have different data retention rules. See [Original data retention](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-based-pricing/overview-data-retention-components).
