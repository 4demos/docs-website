If you're a contributor who wants to collaborate with a writer on a new document, but you'd like the writer to create an outline to get started, this requires some teamwork. Since you'll be collaborating with the writer in your own fork, you'll to do some of the initial steps to get started. Remember that a fork is just a copy of the entire docs repository that will reside in your personal GitHub account.

Here's an overview of the steps you'd take as the contributor:

  1. Ask the writer to give you the directory path where the new work will be done, such as `src/content/docs/logs/get-started` (save this for later).
  2. Go to GitHub and fork the docs-website repository. This creates a copy of the docs-website repository in your personal GitHub account.
  3. Create a branch in your fork of the docs-website repository.
  4. Create a placeholder `.mdx` file in a convenient place on your computer, and then insert a short sentence describing the subject matter.
  5. Upload this file via GitHub.
  6. Create a pull request (PR).
  7. Tell the writer the number of the PR.

When the writer has the PR number, they can make changes directly to your file in the branch of your fork.

For details about how to do each step, see the following sections.

## Create or update a fork of the docs site [#create-update-fork]

1. Go to [https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website), and if you haven't forked the site yet, click **Fork**. Skip to step 2 if you've already forked the docs site.

7. Under **Commit changes**, enter a conventional commit message that follows this pattern: `feat(insert-a-feature-name): Upload a placeholder file for new doc`. This format tells us you’re adding a commit about a feature (feat).

8. Select the option to **Commit directly to the [name of your branch] branch**, and then click **Commit changes**.

## Create a pull request (PR) [#create-pr]

The pull request is the way you start the process of working with the writer on the new material.

1. Click **Compare &amp; pull request** that appears at the top of your screen.

2. In the main field, create a brief title for the pull request (for example, `"What's new" automap post`).

3. In the **Write** tab, replace the writing prompts with any instructions you have about the post. Here are some important instructions to include:

    * Specify the date and the time window when it should be published (morning, mid-day, or evening).
    * Tell us if this post doesn't need a review by a product marketing manager.

4. Click **Create pull request**.

5. If you haven't already signed the CLA (contributor license agreement), you get a prompt in the pull request reminding you to sign it. Make sure you sign this to ensure the PR is accepted:

6. Send the PR number to the writer so they can get started creating an outline for you.

## Delete a branch to start over [#delete-a-branch]

Sometimes you might make a mistake and want to start over. Here’s how you delete a branch in your own fork:

1. Click the **Code** tab, and then click **branches**.

3. If you accidentally delete a branch, you can always click **Restore**.
