From the perspective of the New Relic docs site, “guides” refers to content that is focused on helping customers achieve a larger goal. Guides are typically longer and more wide-ranging in subjects covered than a typical doc. They typically will contain instructions that include the use of several New Relic features or tools, as opposed to normal docs, which often focus on a specific feature or tool. 

This resource will give some requirements and tips for writing and editing guides.

## Talk to the docs team first [#talk-docs-team]

Before starting work on a guide, please talk to the docs team. This is for several reasons: 
* Ensuring we understand how that guide fits into other content and understand where it belongs on the site. 
* Ensuring we minimize redundant content (for example, we might already have content that covers some of the planned content)
* Ensuring we're aligned on structure and strategy (which minimizes edits and discussions later)

## Tips on guide structure [#structure-tips] 

These tips are based on some common issues when we get guide-type content drafts from other teams. The docs team will always do some editing and polishing but we think that reviewing these tips before writing a guide will improve your draft and help make any later editing quicker and easier. These tips are taken from [our style guide](/docs/style-guide/writing-strategies/introduction-style-guide). If you have any questions about structure or style, feel free to reach out to us via our Slack channel. 

Some tips on improving the flow and structure of a doc or guide: 
* Review our existing guides. See if there's a guide that is similar to what you're trying to create and ue that as a template. 
* Place important requirements/prerequisites near the top of the guide, so that customers will understand what they need to complete any procedures in that guide.
* At the beginning of the guide, explain why the content matters to customers. Explain what the point of the guide is and what it will help customers accomplish. 
* Similarly, for each major section of a guide, explain what the point of that section is: why it matters and how it fits into any wider goal or procedure. Sometimes readers skim down and read random sections, or get lost in a long procedure/tutorial, so the more context we can give about what each section's point is, the better. 
If the guide is part of a set of guides, try to explain how your guide ties in with and relates to that larger set of docs, or a specific section of that series.

## Tips on style [#style-tips]

Some style-related tips for writing guides: 
* Aim for clear, non-jargony language: 
  * Avoid creating terms or phrases or acronyms that may be hard for customers to understand (unless we're specifically trying to create a term for some reason, like trying to promote a unique concept or philosophy). The more New Relic-created terms or acronyms we use, the harder it can be to parse. 
* If you use a term or phrase that we've created or that is lesser known, define it at its first use, or link to a resource for more information. 
* When possible attempt to use conversational language that would speak to a wide range of customers, both technical and fairly non-technical. (This will also likely help with search.) 

Tips on capitalization: 
* Don't use title case for terms/names unless you're sure they are proper nouns or trademarked concepts of some sort. (For example, instead of “Service Level Management,” you should use “service level management.”)
* For New Relic features, err on the side of avoiding title case capitalization (e.g., we wouldn't use `Cloud Integration`) unless you're sure it should be capitalized. There are quite a few New Relic features that are often capitalized that shouldn't actually be capitalized. For guidance on this, see [Capitalization](/docs/style-guide/capitalization/product-capability-feature-usage).
* If you have need to refer to an important concept or a guide/resource and need to make it stand out, you can use bold instead of capitalization. For example: “Our **Alert quality management** practice…”
* Hyperlinks: when linking to a New Relic doc or other resource, make the link text a description of that resource. For example: for more information, see the PHP agent configuration doc.

These tips are taken from our style guide. For more information, see [the style guide](/docs/style-guide/writing-strategies/introduction-style-guide).  

## Observability maturity guides: tips on philosophy and structure [#om-tips]

One of the types of guides we have are our observability maturity guides. When drafting an observability maturity guide, it can help to understand some of the philosophy and stylistic choices for that section of guides: 
* "Observability maturity" is what we call New Relic's practice or methodology of how to set up an organization's use of New Relic for optimal observability. It can be referred to as `observability maturity` when referencing the general concept of improving and optimizing observability. It can be referred to as `Observability maturity` when referencing our specific series or, if emphasis is needed, with bold (**Observability maturity**). 
  * It's not referred to as `Observability Maturity`, or `OM`, or `Observability Maturity Architecture` (the internal name of the team that owns this content), or `OMA`. 
* Our observability maturity series includes four core "value drivers" or "practices": **Uptime, performance, and reliability**, **Customer experience**, **Operational efficiency**, and **Innovation and growth**. Each of these areas contains guides that help customers work towards maturity for that value driver.  
* We have an [Observability maturity center in GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/oma-resource-center): this contains some of the resources used in this series (like [this dashboard code and instructions](https://github.com/newrelic/oma-resource-center/tree/main/src/content/docs/oma/value-drivers/customer-experience/use-cases/bottom-of-the-funnel-analysis)), and is linked to from relevant docs.
