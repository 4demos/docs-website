<Callout variant="tip">
  This page is for release notes for downloadable software. For product announcements, see [What's new style guidelines](/docs/style-guide/article-templates/whats-new-style-guidelines/).
</Callout>

To add either type of release note to the site:

1. Find the most recent release note for your agent and make a copy of it.
2. Use the established filenaming convention to name the new file (see note below).
3. Fill in the **subject**, **releaseDate**, **version**, and/or **watermark** fields.
4. Write the content for your new release note, following the established pattern.
5. Commit your changes and submit a pull request.

<Callout variant="tip">
To avoid potential naming conflicts, use a `-` separator in your file name. For example: Node.js agent v1.2.3 would result in the name `node-agent-1-2-3`. If there was no separator, 12.3 could collide with 1.2.3 in future.

A Tech Docs hero will review your release note content and approve your pull request to get it published.

We only build and deploy the site a few times a day, and currently builds can take a few hours to complete. If your release is time-sensitive, ensure you've planned for enough time to get the docs live.
