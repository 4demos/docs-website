What is the purpose of a navigation sidebar menu? This is worth considering, because this reader experience is pretty ubiquitous across doc sites, and things that are everywhere tend not to be considered much.

I think a nav menu serves two fundamental purposes:

1. Help readers find the information they're looking for
2. Give readers insight into the conceptual model of a body of knowledge (in our case, a conceptual model of New Relic)

## Find information [#find]

When I imagine someone finding information, I find that my initial impulse is to picture someone moving in a straight line from question to answer. I feel this impulse, even though I know it to be false!

When human beings move through collections of information—whether it's a docs site, a bookstore, or a temporary collection of information created from an internet search—they do so in a meandering, inefficient, and emotionally impulsive way. Although this process is inefficient, it's the primary way that human beings build conceptual models of understanding!

The ground-breaking library scientist, Marcia Bates, described this organic process of information gathering as [berrypicking](https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/bates/berrypicking.html). In her model, **browsing** is what people do when they're trying to make sense of a poorly understood body of knowledge. 

As I see it, the left nav menu is **primarily a tool for browsing**.

## Conceptual model [#model]

When our conceptual model of New Relic is confusing to us, our nav is going to reflect that. This does a disservice both to our readers and ourselves.

When we look at the nav and are confused by how its organized, this is a fundamentally useful clue to us (the docs team) that we need to work on our conceptual model. 

As a reader browses through our nav, are they picking up on key terms? Are they starting to get a sense of the shape of New Relic as a system? Are they able to build enough of a mental model to take action in a meaningful way?

## Search and the nav [#search]

There's one thing that browsing in a nav is profoundly unsuited for: finding a specific piece of content in a body of knowledge. No matter how much we fine-tune and improve the navigation information architecture, we'll never get it to place where someone can use it to find a single, specific doc on our site. Using the nav to find a specific doc is a bit like using a map of the United States to navigate to a small town in eastern Oregon. 

Search, on the other hand, is an excellent tool for navigating to a specific doc **if you know what search terms to use**. We can use our nav to surface important keywords that someone can use to search for specific docs content.

## Best practices [#best]

Given all of the above, here are some initial high-level nav best practices, represented as a series of questions about the nav: 

* Does the nav give me clear direction on where I should start reading?
* Look at the nav, can I tell which docs are most important?
* How many clicks in the nav do I need to do before I get a clear call to action?
* Does the nav introduce me to important keywords I need to know? (Are there any important keywords that are missing?)
* Does the nav show a clear progression or user journey I might follow to success?
