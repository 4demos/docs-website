To get started with browser monitoring, you'll need to add our browser agent to your web application. Then the browser agent will monitor your app's performance and send that data to New Relic.

Follow the steps below to create a browser app in our UI, configure the browser agent, and then instrument your web application with the agent.

## Before you begin

Check to see if your browser app meets these compatibility requirements:
  * [SPAs (Single-page applications)](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/spa-compatibility-requirements/)
  * [Non-SPAs](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring/)

<Steps>

<Step>
### Create a browser app in our UI

First, create a browser app in our UI by going to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**. Click **Add data**, then under **Data sources** select **Browser monitoring**.

  title="Add your app"

/>

</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Choose a deployment method [#step-3]

When it comes to deploying the browser agent to your web application, you have three methods:

* Method 1: Enable via New Relic APM
  * If you're using an <InlinePopover type="apm" /> (application performance monitoring) agent to monitor the backend-side of your browser app, then you should use this APM option. We recommend this option because the APM agent will automatically deploy the browser agent to every page of your website and you'll automatically get the latest version of the browser agent whenever you restart your APM agent.

  OR

* Method 2: Copy/Paste JavaScript snippet
  * Use this method if you can't use the first method, due to reasons like you're not using an APM agent or the APM agent does not support injecting the browser agent. If you choose this option, you'll copy the customized JavaScript snippet in the New Relic UI, once all configurations have been made, and paste it into your application's HTML.

  OR

* Method 3: NPM package
  * If you want to incorporate the agent into your applications source code and tool chain or want more control over what features of the browser agent are deployed with your application, we do publish a NPM package that you can use. If you choose this method, you will use your application's JavaScript tooling to install, incorporate, deploy, and update the browser agent.
  * **Note:** this option is not currently integrated into the installation UI. Select the Copy/Paste method to continue the installation for now.

In the UI, select a deployment method and move on to the next step.

<img
  title="choose a deployment method"
  alt="choose a deployment method"
  src={browserInstallStep2}
  style={{ maxWidth: '70%' }}
/>

</Step>

<Step>
### (Optional) Enable distributed tracing

Next, you can choose to enable distributed tracing to help understand how your app's frontend and backend activity are connected. Read more about distributed tracing [here](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/browser-data-distributed-tracing/).

<img
  title="enable distributed tracing"
  alt="enable distributed tracing"
  src={browserInstallStep3}
  style={{ maxWidth: '70%' }}
/>
</Step>

<Step>
### Name your browser app

When selecting a name for your browser app, you've got two options:

* Select an existing app already monitored by an APM agent.
* Create a new name for a standalone browser app.

Choose one of these options and click **Enable**.

<img
  title="name or connect an existing browser app"
  alt="name or connect an existing browser app"
  src={browserInstallStep4}
  style={{ maxWidth: '70%' }}
/>
</Step>

<Step>
### (For copy/paste method only) Inject the JavaScript snippet

If you selected the copy/paste option, it's time to add the JavaScript snippet to your browser app's HTML.

In the UI, copy the JavaScript snippet that's been customized for your app instrumentation, and paste it into the `<head>` tag for your web app.

<Callout variant="tip">
  The head tag typically handles third party scripts, fonts, etc., that load on all your app pages, so you'll only need to paste it into one place. Make sure to paste it as close to the top of the `<head>` as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (such as X-UA-Compatible and charset). For more information on the snippet placement, see [JavaScript placement requirements](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/instrumentation-browser-monitoring#javascript-placement).
</Callout>

/>
<figCaption>
  The JavaScript snippet is blurred in this screenshot because it contains sensitive data (account ID, license key, etc.). You must copy and paste your own unique JavaScript snippet from the UI.

* [Python](/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/page-load-timing-python)
* [Ruby](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/features/page-load-timing-ruby)
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### (For NPM package only) Install and setup the NPM package

If you wish to use the NPM package method, open your application and install the `@newrelic/browser-agent` NPM package. Once installed, open the main entrypoint source file for you application and import the browser agent.

```javascript
import { BrowserAgent } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/loaders/browser-agent'
```

You will need to initialize the `BrowserAgent` class with configuration options. These options can currently be found in the JavaScript snippet in the New Relic UI (see previous step). The snippet also contains the current loader. Copy only the configuration parts of the snippet from the UI and instantiate the `BrowserAgent` class like so:

```javascript
new BrowserAgent({
  init: {}, // NREUM.init part of the snippet
  loader_config: {}, // NREUM.loader_config part of the snippet
  info: {} // NREUM.info part of the snippet
})
```

You will need to redeploy your application to make the changes live.

Need to customize the browser agent features included in your application? Checkout the browser agent package on the NPM package [hub](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@newrelic/browser-agent).

</Step>

<Step>
### Generate traffic for your app [#step-6]

Congratulations, you're done installing the browser agent! Now you'll need to generate traffic for your app and wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic.

<Callout variant="tip">
Not seeing data?

It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If you're still not seeing data, check out [common browser installation problems and solutions](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-your-browser-monitoring-installation/).
