This guide will familiarize you with core web vitals and learn how to monitor them with New Relic. 

## What are core web vitals?

Core web vitals are Google’s metrics to gauge overall user experience of your site, which can influence your site’s SEO rankings and give you valuable insight into how users perceive your business. They are:

* Largest contentful paint (loading performance)
* First input delay (interactivity between user input and browser response)
* Cumulative layout shift (visual stability)

## Why do web vitals matter? 

Higher scores can help your organization save money and increase SEO. Lower scores can affect your users' perceptions of your organization's website, which could result in dissatisfied customers or lost business opportunities. 

This is why it’s important to monitor your site’s core web vitals and take action on low scores - and New Relic can help you do that!

## Monitor core web vitals with New Relic

With New Relic, you can monitor your site’s core web vitals and answer questions like:
* Are my users having an overall good browser app experience? If not, where are the problem areas?
* How are my most important pages performing over time?
* How do changes to the site impact web vitals?

To monitor web vitals, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser > (select an app) > Monitor > Web vitals**.

## Drill down into specific pages
If you want to get insights into an important page, like which browser or device is contributing to a poor Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) score, click on the page URL in the Page URL table. Use this data to understand how your end users are experiencing your most important pages and what’s contributing to poor scores.

## Filter by key attributes
If you want to investigate something particular, like how a backend change or performance issue impacted core web vitals, you can use the Filter by tool to filter any key attribute. 
Here are some filtering examples:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="user-info-example"
    title="User information: filter by `userID`"
  >
For example, an end-user complained about performance issues in your site’s checkout page on November 1, around 12pm, and you want to see what happened during this user’s session. To investigate in **Web vitals**:
1. Set the time range to November 1, 11am-1pm. 
2. In the **Page URL** table, click on the home page URL.
3. In the **Filter by** field, set **Attribute** to `userID` and **Value** to `user ID`.
  <Callout variant="tip">
  `userID` is used to track custom users via the browser SPA API. Learn more at [Set custom attribute](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/setcustomattribute-browser-agent-api/).
  </Callout> 
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="resource-example"
    title="Resources: filter by `elementTagName`"
  >
  For example, your organization recently updated images on the site’s home page on November 10, at 8am, and you want to see if the changes impacted core web vitals. To investigate in **Web vitals**:
1. Set the time range to when you deployed the changes.
2. In the **Page URL** table, click on the home page URL.
3. In the **Filter by** field, set **Attribute** to `elementTagName` and **Value** to `IMG`.
  </Collapser>

   <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="user-info-example"
    title="Devices: filter by `deviceType`)"
  >
  For example, you want to compare desktop vs. mobile performance, and see which platform has better core web vitals. To investigate in **Web vitals**:
1. In the **Filter by** field, set **Attribute** to`deviceType` and **Value** to `desktop`.
2. In a duplicate browser, set **Attribute** to`deviceType` and **Value** to `mobile` and compare the results. 
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Troubleshoot missing data

### Problem

I'm not seeing data in **Web vitals**.

### Solution

Here are some causes of missing data:

* Your filters are too narrow. Some key attributes are only relevant to certain web vitals. For example, if you filtered by `elementID`, data would only populate for largest contentful paint (LCP) because `elementID` is only applicable to measuring LCP. 

* Your browser agent or edition doesn’t collect certain data. To learn about what key attributes the New Relic browser agent collects, see https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary/?dataSource=Browser+agent. 

* Your app can’t send `PageViewTiming` data to New Relic. Web vitals is built on `PageViewTiming` data, so if for some reason your app is unable to send ingest to our collector, data may not appear.
