There are several configuration options that regulate what data the browser agent reports. This is a factor when [enabling browser monitoring](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent), and you can also change these configurations afterward.

To get to the **Application settings** page, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings**.
