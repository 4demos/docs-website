    Partner account users typically use SAML-SSO to sign in through your New
    Relic partner site. You may not have separate passwords or authentication
    information for your New Relic account.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you use an email address associated with a New Relic partner account when
    you first sign in to the New Relic mobile app, New Relic will send you a
    confirmation email for authentication. Android app users will also see a
    notification message.
  </p>
  <div className="callout-important">
    <p>
      The authentication email <a href="#email">expires 20 minutes</a> after it
      is sent.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Non-partner accounts: When you enter your email address, you will see a
    screen with a field where you enter your password.

      From the New Relic mobile app, type your email address associated with the
      partner account.

    </li>
    <li>
      Retrieve the authentication email from your mobile device within 20
      minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Select the <b>Authenticate</b> button (Android users) or email link
      (Android or iOS users) in the email to log in to New Relic.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    You will be redirected to the New Relic mobile app and logged in to your
    partner account.

  <h2 id="email">Troubleshoot email problems</h2>
  <p>Here are some troubleshooting tips:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you cannot find the authentication message from New Relic in your
      mobile device's email in-box, check your <b>Spam</b> folder.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you miss the 20-minute deadline, sign in to the New Relic mobile app
      again, then select the link to resend the authentication email.
    </li>
  </ul>
