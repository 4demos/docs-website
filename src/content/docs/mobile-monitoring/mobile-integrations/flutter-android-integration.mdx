Our Flutter integration for Android monitors the performance of your Android mobile app built with Flutter, helping you diagnose issues in your app and optimize your code. This integration makes use of our Android mobile agent, and gives you a pre-built dashboard with your most important Flutter app metrics (like errors, app crashes, app launches, app installations, HTTP errors, and network failures).

After setting up our Flutter integration, we give you a dashboard with your Flutter web app metrics.

## Requirements [#requirements]

Requirements include: 

* Android API version 24 or higher
* Uses our [Android agent](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/get-started/new-relic-android-compatibility-requirements)
* Flutter version 2.5.0 or higher
* Dart version between 2.16.2 and 3.0.0

## Install [#install]

### Step 1 (optional): Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

Installing the infrastructure agent is optional, but doing this will get you important metrics about the host where your app is running. 

To do this, follow [the infrastructure agent install steps](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) for the host containing your Flutter app.

### Step 2: Install the Android agent [#mobile-install] 

Our Flutter integration relies on our browser agent to work. To install our Flutter integration for Android: 

1. Install the Flutter integration with a command like: 
    ```
    $ flutter pub add newrelic_mobile
    ```
2. This adds a line like the following to your package's `pubspec.yaml` (and runs an implicit Flutter pub get):
    ```
    dependencies:
    newrelic_mobile: ^0.0.1-dev.8
    ```

    Alternatively, your editor might support Flutter pub get. To learn more, see the docs for your editor.
3. Import the New Relic integration. In your Dart code, you can use:
	```
  import 'package:newrelic_mobile/newrelic_mobile.dart';
  ```
4. Next, open your `main.dart` and add the following code to launch New Relic. Note you'll need to input the `appToken`, which is platform-specific.

```
import 'package:newrelic_mobile/newrelic_mobile.dart';


  var appToken = "";

  if (Platform.isAndroid) {
    appToken = "YOUR_ANDROID_APP_TOKEN";
  } else if (Platform.isIOS) {
    appToken = "YOUR_IOS_APP_TOKEN";
  }

  Config config =
      Config(accessToken: appToken,

      //Android Specific
      // Optional:Enable or disable collection of event data.
      analyticsEventEnabled: true,

      // Optional:Enable or disable reporting successful HTTP requests to the MobileRequest event type.
      networkErrorRequestEnabled: true,

      // Optional:Enable or disable reporting network and HTTP request errors to the MobileRequestError event type.
      networkRequestEnabled: true,

      // Optional:Enable or disable crash reporting.
      crashReportingEnabled: true,

      // Optional:Enable or disable interaction tracing. Trace instrumentation still occurs, but no traces are harvested. This will disable default and custom interactions.
      interactionTracingEnabled: true,

      // Optional:Enable or disable capture of HTTP response bodies for HTTP error traces, and MobileRequestError events.
       httpResponseBodyCaptureEnabled: true,

      // Optional: Enable or disable agent logging.
      loggingEnabled: true,

      //iOS Specific
      // Optional:Enable/Disable automatic instrumentation of WebViews
      webViewInstrumentation: true,
      
      //Optional: Enable or Disable Print Statements as Analytics Events
      printStatementAsEventsEnabled : true
      
      );

  NewrelicMobile.instance.start(config, () {
    runApp(MyApp());
  });
```

## Find your data [#find-data]

To get your Flutter dashboard: 

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the [**Add data** page](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace). 
2. Click on **Dashboards**.
3. In the search bar, type `flutter android`. 
4. The dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

Your Flutter dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the **Dashboards** UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

This integration reports data in the form of our [mobile monitoring events](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/event-data/events-reported-mobile-monitoring). If you installed the infrastructure agent, you'll also receive [infrastructure data](/docs/infrastructure/manage-your-data/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-monitoring-data/#infrastructure-events). 

Here's an example NRQL query that returns mobile request errors faceted by type of error: 

```sql
FROM MobileRequestError SELECT count(*) 
FACET `errorType` TIMESERIES
```
