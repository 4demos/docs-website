With our React Native agent, your team can monitor the performance of its hybrid apps and identify code errors. Our agent collects crash data, network traffic, and other information for hybrid apps using native components. This allows your team to understand the health of your hybrid app regardless of the platform. We empower your team to make more informed development choices by providing insight into Javascript errors, distributed tracing, network instrumentation, and more. 

## Install the React Native agent [#Install-the-React-Native-agent]

### Requirements [#Requirements]

Before you install the React Native agent, ensure your app meets these requirements:

* Android API 21 or higher
* iOS 10
* React Native version 0.63 or higher
  
  * [iOS native requirements](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/get-started/new-relic-ios-compatibility-requirements)
  * [Android native requirements](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/get-started/new-relic-android-compatibility-requirements)
  
  Native support levels are based on [React Native requirements](https://github.com/facebook/react-native#-requirements).

### Step one of install [#Step-one-of-install]

To install the  agent:

1. Run this `yarn` command:
  ```sh
   yarn add newrelic-react-native-agent
  ```
2. Run the following:
  ```shell
  npm i newrelic-react-native-agent
  ```

### Step two of install [#Step-two-of-install]

To set up the React Native agent, you need to start it with `index.js`. AppToken is platform-specific so you will need to generate the separate token for Android and iOS apps. Open your index.js and add the following code to launch NewRelic:

```js
import NewRelic from 'newrelic-react-native-agent';
import * as appVersion from './package.json';
import {Platform} from 'react-native';

    let appToken;

    if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
        appToken = '<IOS-APP-TOKEN>';
    } else {
        appToken = '<ANDROID-APP-TOKEN>';
    }


NewRelic.startAgent(appToken);
NewRelic.setJSAppVersion(appVersion.version);

```

### Step three: Android setup [#Step-three-android-setup]

To ensure that the React Native agent is compatible with Android, install the Android specific agent:

1. Install the New Relic native Android agent using these [instructions ](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/install-android-apps-gradle-android-studio).
2. Update `build.gradle`:
  ```java
    buildscript {
      ...
      repositories {
        ...
        mavenCentral()
      }
      dependencies {
        ...
        classpath "com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-gradle-plugin:6.4.1"
      }
    }
  ```

3. Update `app/build.gradle`:
  ```
    apply plugin: "com.android.application"
    apply plugin: 'newrelic' // <-- add this
  ```

4. Make sure your app requests `INTERNET` and `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permissions by adding these lines to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
  ```
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
  ```

### Step four: XCFramework setup [#Step-four-XCFramework-setup]
To ensure that the React Native agent is compatible with all iOS frameworks,  install the New Relic XCFramework agent:

1. Install the New Relic XCFramework agent:

    ```shell
   npx pod-install
   ```

### Optional: Expo integration [#Optional-expo-integration]

Integration with Expo is possible in both bare workflow and [custom managed workflow](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/customizing/) via [config plugins](https://docs.expo.io/guides/config-plugins/).

* [Bare workflow](https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/managed-vs-bare/#bare-workflow): Please follow the above installation steps instead.
* [Managed workflow](https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/managed-vs-bare/#bare-workflow): After installing our package, add the config plugin to the plugins array of your `app.json` or `app.config.js`.

For the managed work flow, you need to use the `expo prebuild --clean` command as described in the [Adding custom native code](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/) guide to rebuild your app with the plugin changes. If this command is not running, you'll get errors when starting the New Relic agent.

## Modify and understand your data [#Modify-and-understand-your-data]

### API calls [#API-calls]

Our React Native agent utilizes the same API calls as our iOS and Android SDK agents. Please refer to [New Relic iOS SDK doc](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/ios-sdk-api) or [Android SDK](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/android-sdk-api).

### JavaScript errors [#JavaScript-errors]

You can see JavaScript errors under the custom events section and you can also query them using NRQL.

   <img
      title="JavaScript errors within custom events"
      alt="This is an image of React Native JavaScript errors recorded under custom events"
      src={reactnativejavascripterrors}
    />

You can also build a dashboard for errors using this query:

  ```sql
  SELECT jsAppVersion,name,Message,errorStack,isFatal FROM `JS Errors` SINCE 24 hours ago
  ```
   If you need help getting started with dashboards, see [Introduction to dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#get-started).
