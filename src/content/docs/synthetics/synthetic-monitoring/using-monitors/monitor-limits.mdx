A synthetic monitoring check is an individual execution of a synthetic monitor. When a monitor runs from one location, it counts as one check, so you can also think of synthetics check as a synthetics job, or a job execution. 

For example, if a monitor is configured to run once per hour from 5 locations, then that comes out to `24 * 5` checks per day, totaling 120 checks. Your organization's pricing edition determines your check limits and you can view and facet the number of checks that have been executed. 

## Pricing edition and check limits

Your organization's [pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) determines how many synthetic monitor checks can be run per month. These limits apply to all [monitor types](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/types-synthetic-monitors) except the simple ping monitor. 

The following are synthetic monitor check limits by pricing edition: 

* Free tier: 500 per month
* Standard edition: 10K per month
* Pro edition: 1M per month
* Enterprise edition: 10M per month

## View Historical Consumption [#consumption]

The [NrDailyUsage event](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrDailyUsage) is generated once per day so you can view synthetics consumption.

By using [`FACET`](docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-facet), you can break your consumption into multiple categories, including account, location, monitor type, and monitor name. Run these queries in [parent or partner accounts](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/parent-child-account-structure/) to obtain aggregated consumption across your account structure.

Both successful and failed checks contribute to overall synthetics consumption. Below are sample queries to view and facet your synthetics consumption:
