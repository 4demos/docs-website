title: Troubleshooting with telemetry in context
metaDescription: Get relevant metrics, events, logs, traces, and other telemetry data within the context of your app or host, without additional configuration or context switching in the New Relic One UI.
---

When you're troubleshooting an issue in your app or host, you need all the New Relic One tools at your fingertips. But you don't want to do a lot of context switching across the UI or be overwhelmed by the wealth of information available.

Our telemetry in context functionality gives you an easy way to troubleshoot problems across your apps, services, other entities, and data types, without having to leave the current UI page you're viewing. Best of all, there's no additional configuration required.

We curate the data automatically, so that highly correlated log data related to your errors, traces, infrastructure, etc. is already visible. And if you're missing related key telemetry, you can add more attributes to make your troubleshooting focus even more precise.

## Get started [#get-started]

Ready to get started?

1. If you don't have one already, [create a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup). It's free, forever.
2. Update to the [supported agent version](#agents) for your apps and hosts.

No additional configuration required! Then go to New Relic One:

* Explorer UI at [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)
* Explorer UI for EU region data center if applicable: [one.eu.newrelic.com](https://one.eu.newrelic.com)

## Supported agent versions [#agents]

Update to the supported agent version for your apps or hosts as applicable:

* Java
* .NET
* Ruby
* Infrastructure

If your APM agent does not support our telemetry in context solution, you can continue to use our [standard logs in context solutions](/docs/logs/logs-context/logs-in-context).

## Ingest limits [#ingest]

Using telemetry in context functionality will increase your data ingest, and this may have an impact on your ingest limits and billing. To avoid any surprises, we recommend that you create an alert condition or use the following NRQL query.

## Data privacy [#data-privacy]

Our log management service automatically masks number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see our [security documentation](/docs/logs/get-started/new-relics-log-management-security-privacy) for log management.

You can also use our obfuscation options to hash or mask sensitive data in your logs. For more information see our documentation:

* [Obfuscation via UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/obfuscation-ui)
* [Obfuscation via NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-log-data-obfuscation), the New Relic GraphQL explorer
