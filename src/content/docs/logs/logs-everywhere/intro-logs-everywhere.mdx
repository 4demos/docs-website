metaDescription: Learn how New Relic links your metadata to relevant logs.

If you're familiar with [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/), you know that you can:

* Link the logs related to traces and errors for your apps and hosts.
* View the logs directly within the context of those issues.

"Logs everywhere" in New Relic goes beyond the logs in context functionality. If an attribute exists in both a log event and another event, you can connect the two so that you can see logs for **any** metadata you choose.

## Example: See related logs for app [#example-app]

**Reviewer:** I'm not convinced I really understand what is going on here and how to take advantage of the chart data that's easily available from Explorer. Please edit ruthlessly!

To see the related logs, use the Explorer in New Relic One. Here is an example:

With logs in context, your app's **Summary** page shows a chart with related logs. The UI shows the number of logs faceted by the level of severity for the app. These log trends and totals are the golden metrics that can quickly expose if a problem is potentially detected in logs or solvable by viewing detailed log entries.

The right sidebar of your app's **Summary** page lists related entities. In this example, the app has a related entity set up as a workload to monitor error tracking. When you click the workload, you can see the total number of logs and what percentage are errors.

From here you can view related logs in context of your traces and errors by selecting any of the following links on the left sidebar of your app's **Summary** page:

* **Monitor > Distributed tracing**
* **Triage > Logs**
* **Events > Errors** 

## Example: See related logs for host [#example-host]

**Reviewer:** Can you please provide a permalink to a host (Demotron?) that shows "logs everywhere" or "logs in Explorer" in action? Not sure what this is currently called (as of 11-22-2021). Thanks!

## Get started with logs everywhere [#get-started]

**Reviewer:** What's next? Is there special setup required, or will it automatically be presented in the UI?
