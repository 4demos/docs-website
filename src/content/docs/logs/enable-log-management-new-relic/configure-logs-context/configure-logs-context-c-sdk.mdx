metaDescription: How to link log data for apps monitored by the C SDK with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform.

Logs in context is not available for apps monitored by the C SDK. Instead, you can build your own logging extension library by using the [Log API](/docs/logs/log-management/log-api/introduction-log-api/).

To [enable distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/language-agents-enable-distributed-tracing/#update-agents) for apps monitored by the C SDK, [install](/docs/agents/c-sdk/install-configure/install-c-sdk-compile-link-your-code/) or [update](/docs/agents/c-sdk/install-configure/update-your-c-sdk-library/) to the latest C SDK version. Use [C SDK version 1.1.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/c-sdk-release-notes/) for distributed tracing.
