Got an idea for a cool feature? Notice an odd, unintended behavior? Good news: we've made it easier to submit feature requests and report bugs.

Our issue tracker brings our engineers closer to you. With your New Relic account, you can submit an issue that may be considered for future roadmaps. While in the issue tracker backlog, other New Relic customers can give your issue a +1 by upvoting your issue, adding comments, or attaching files. Similarly, the issue tracker lets you see in realtime what projects Relics are working on currently.

## Meet the issue tracker [#meet]

```<img src={landingPage} alt="New Relic issue tracker landing page" title="Issue tracker landing page" />```

Anyone can view the issues filed through our tracker, but only New Relic account owners can submit, vote, or comment on an issue. Don’t have an account? No big deal. [It’s free to sign up!](https://newrelic.com/signup).

Using your New Relic credentials, we'll notify you whenever your request or bug moves through our triage process. You can expect a review within 10 business days, but mileage may vary depending on votes, complexity, and issue severity.

We want to hear from you. But more than that, we want to act on your suggestions. If a dozen people request the same feature in 12 different tickets, that request runs the risk of falling through the cracks. To avoid that, you can search our backlog and **Vote on an issue**.

1. From the [issue tracker](issues.newrelic.com) landing page, click on **Search** in the top nav.  
2. To search for a specific issue within a certain criteria, select **Search for issues** and use [Jira query language](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/jira-software/jql-the-most-flexible-way-to-search-jira-14) (JQL) to search for an issue.
3. View submitted issues by selecting one of the quick filters at the bottom of the issues dropdown.
4. View your open issues by clicking **My open issues**.  

If an issue already fits your needs, then click **Vote for this issue**. The more votes an issue has, the more likely our teams can evaluate it for a future roadmap.

```<img src={voteIssue} alt="Vote on an issue with our issue tracker" title="New Relic vote feature on the issue tracker" />```

Have you experienced a situation where the request could’ve saved your team time and money? Does a particular request fit into a long-term strategy? Comments are a good place to tell us. Even if you're not the issue owner, you can **Add a comment** or **Attach a file** describing how that particular issue affects your team.

So you have a feature idea that solves a problem for your team, and you're ready to send something our way. 

<img src={featureRequest} alt="Feature request form" title="Feature request Create window." />
<figcaption>**issues.newrelic.com** > **Create**: Fill out this form to submit a request</figcaption>

1. Click **Create** in the top nav. The **Create issue** form will appear.  
2. In **Issue type**, select **Feature request**. The **Project** field always defaults to **New Relic Public (NEWRELIC)**.
3. In **Summary**, write a concise description. For example, “Support tags filtering in CloudFront metrics” describes the product area for the feature (“Cloudfront metrics”), as well as the behavior of the feature (“Support tags filtering”).
4. Choose the Visibility setting. 
        * **Public** issues are the default option, and their details are visible to anyone.
        * **Private** issues are only visible to New Relic and the reporter. Make the issue private if you're including sensitive information (such as a screenshot with customer information, or a file containing company logs). If you're uncertain about the information, review our [Terms of use]().
5. Elaborate on the summary in **Description**. You can attach a screenshot or other files in this field.  Unsure of what to write? Jump to a later section in the doc about [writing clear, descriptive tickets](#what).
6. At the bottom of the window, click Create.

<Callout variant="important">
Keep in mind that after you submit an issue, you cannot delete or edit the information you've submitted. On the other hand, if you want to provide additional information, then you can leave comments or attach files.
</Callout>

You’ll receive emails whenever we make an update to the ticket. After submitting your request, expect an initial assessment after 10 business days. Any decisions made about your request will be available in the ticket for reference. We ask that you keep in mind:

* Submitting a ticket doesn't guarantee its selection for our product roadmap. 
* The complexity of the request, timing, resources, and our existing commitments additionally contribute to our decisions.

Sometimes tech behaves in unexpected ways. Buggy behavior can be something as small as a minor inconvenience, or something that impedes your team’s productivity. While it’s never ideal  to encounter a bug, our issue tracker allows you to file a report as soon as you encounter a bug.

## The ins-and-outs of submitted issues [#ins]

While directly editing issues isn't supported by the issue tracker, there are workarounds:

* Change the visibility of a public ticket to private by adding `!Private` in a comment on your submitted ticket. You can't change a private ticket to public.  
* Delete an attachment by hovering over the image and clicking the trashcan icon. Click **Delete**.

</Collapser>
<Collapser
id="status"
title="Understand issue statuses"

There are intermediate states between a newly submitted ticket and an already triaged ticket.

* **Gathering interest stage**: During this stage, customers can vote, leave comments, or add attachments. Feature requests stay in this status for 12 months.
* **Planned**: When an issue moves to this status, it means your issue has been selected. Expect some implementation in the next 12 months.

## What is a clear, descriptive ticket? [#what]

Our very first suggestion is to write clear, descriptive tickets. Don't worry too much about grammar or length, as long as you convey good information. A relic manages the rest in triage.

Some good details you might consider including for feature requests and bugs:

* A problem faced by your team that our product can address.
* A feature that [EXAMPLE]

Some good details we recommend for reporting bugs:

*
*

We intend to understand your request entirely. After you submit a request, we might ask for additional information.
