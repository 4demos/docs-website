This quick launch guide is for teams who are brand new to New Relic and who want to get started bringing in some data and experiencing some essential platform experiences. 

## Before you start [#before-start]

Some things to know before you start: 

* There are many ways to set up and use New Relic, depending on your systems and your goals. This guide will walk you through some setup procedures that many of our customers find useful. 
* When you're done with this, you can complete your setup by adding more data and doing additional configuration.

If you prefer a more manual approach (for example, if you need to deploy at scale), see the **Advanced install** options below.

Below are some manual install procedures for some of our more important tools. (Alternatively, if your goal is simply to test out and learn about New Relic, the [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.explorer?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtY29yZS5saXN0aW5nIn0=&cards[0]=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYy5ucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYyIsImFjdGl2ZUNvbXBvbmVudCI6IlZUU09FbnZpcm9ubWVudCIsInBhdGgiOiJndWlkZWQifQ==) may be a good first step, followed by more manual installation procedures.)
