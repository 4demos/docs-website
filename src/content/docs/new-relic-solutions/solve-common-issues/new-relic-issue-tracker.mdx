We've made it easier than ever to send feature requests and report bugs directly to our expert engineers. Submit a feature idea, report a bug, or check out what New Relic is working on. Either way, this guide provides a practical overview of working with our issue tracker. 

## Meet the issue tracker [#meet]

```<img src={landingPage} alt="New Relic issue tracker landing page" title="Issue tracker landing page" />```

Anyone with and without a New Relic account can view the public issues filed through our tracker, but only New Relic users can submit, vote, or comment on an issue. Don’t have an account? No big deal. [It’s free to sign up](https://newrelic.com/signup)!

Using your New Relic username, we'll notify you as your request or report moves through our triage process. Although we can't promise we'll be able to address every feature request or bug that gets submitted, we're committed to reviewing your issue within 10 business days.

We want to hear from you. But more than that, we want to act on your suggestions. If seven people request the same feature in seven different tickets, that request runs the risk of falling through the cracks. To avoid that, you can search our issue library and **Vote on an issue**.

1. From the [issue tracker](issues.newrelic.com) landing page, click on **Search** in the top nav.  
2. To search for a specific issue within a certain criteria, select **Search for issues** and use [Jira query language](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/jira-software/jql-the-most-flexible-way-to-search-jira-14) (JQL) to make your search.
3. View submitted issues by selecting one of the quick filters at the bottom of the issues dropdown.
4. View your open issues by clicking **My open issues**.  

If an issue already fits your needs, then click **Vote for this issue**. Additionally, you can leave comments on existing issues describing how a patricular function can benefit your team. By using votes and comments, you let our teams know what's most important to you so they can evaluate it for putting on our roadmap.

Once you've determined that your feature request doesn't exist in our library, it's time to file a feature request issue.

Buggy behavior can be something as small as a minor inconvenience or something that impedes your team’s productivity. While it’s never ideal  to encounter a bug, our issue tracker allows you to file a report as soon as you encounter a bug.

<Callout variant="important">
After you submit an issue, you cannot delete or edit the information you've submitted. On the other hand, if you want to provide additional information, then you can leave comments or attach files.
</Callout>

## Public vs. private visibility

You can make an issue public or private.

* Public issues are the default option, and their details are visible to anyone.
* Private issues are visible only to New Relic and the reporter. Make the issue private if you're including sensitive information (such as a screenshot with customer information or company logs). If you're uncertain about the information, review our [Terms of use](SOMETHING).
* Change the visibility of a public ticket to private by adding `!Private` in a comment on your submitted ticket. You can't change a private ticket to public. 

Because of how the issue tracker functions, we want to stress that when attaching additional context to an issue:

* Check that any proprietary, customer, or otherwise sensitive and confidential info has been removed from screenshots or attachments.
* Set the issue to **Private** when in doubt. 

## To do, or not to do 

The nature of the issue tracker lets you interact and collaborate with New Relic employees and users. 

* Review the [Terms of use]() to understand our expectations for using the issue tracker. 
* If something is in violation of our [Code of conduct]() and [Reporting guidelines](), then [SOMETHING ACTION HERE].
* Double- then triple-check that any proprietary, customer, or otherwise sensitive and confidential info has been removed from screenshots or attachments.

## What happens to my issue after it's submitted?

When your issue is submitted, it goes into our library of in-progress and closed issues. The issue is then triaged and sent to its relevant teams. At this point the team reviews the issue and decides if or when the work will go on our roadmap.

If you either submitted or opted to watch an issue, you'll receive emails whenever we make an update to the ticket. After submitting your request, expect an initial assessment after 10 business days. Any decisions made about your request will be available in the ticket for reference. We ask that you keep in mind:

* Submitting a ticket doesn't guarantee its selection for our product roadmap. 
* The complexity of the request, timing, resources, and our existing commitments additionally contribute to our decisions. 

## What is a clear, concise description? [#what]

Our very first suggestion is to write a clear, concise description. Don't worry too much about grammar or length, as long as you convey good information. Our triage team decides what happens next.

Some good info to include in your feature request description:

* Is your feature request related to a problem? If so, describe the problem.
* What is the expected outcome for your solution?
* Why should we work on this? What use cases does it support?
* Are there any screenshots you can include?

Some good info to include in your bug report description:

* What are the steps to reproduce this bug?
* What is the expected behavior?
* Are there any screenshots you can include?
* What environment are you using?

We intend to understand your request entirely. After you submit a request, we might ask for additional information.
