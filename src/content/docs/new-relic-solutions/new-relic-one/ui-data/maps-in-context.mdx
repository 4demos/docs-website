New Relic can take data from instrumented entities and create topological maps that display the relationships between them. Our maps capability use a source (like an entity or a service) as an entry point into the rest of your system, letting you understand how your hosts, services, and applications relate to and affect each other.

## Omnimap-powered maps [#omni]

Service maps, workloads maps, and automap share the same maps engine, called omnimap. These omnimap-powered maps are entity-scoped, and share key features and design. For example, omnimap-powered maps structure your system architecture into three general tiers: **UX**, **Service**, and **Infrastructure**. Across these tiers are nodes that represent groups of related entities, connected by arrows.

  alt="A screenshot of the omnimap-powered maps experience. The screenshot shows a UI separated by white lines into three tiers. They are ordered vertically with UX as the top tier, Service as the second tier, and Infrastructure as the third tier."
  src={omnimapServiceMaps}
/>

Maps will use the standard [health status colors](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/view-entity-health-status-find-entities-without-alert-conditions/#colors) to indicate entity health across different experiences.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="omni-health"
    title="Explore health status with omnimap-powered maps"

The top pane allows you to adjust your map's appearance. You can search for a specific entity, de-emphasize nodes by health status, or hide entity types. You can also adjust timewarp, which shows your entity's health status over the last three hours.

The right pane houses snapshots of data about your system performance:

  title="Omnimap-powered service maps right pane"
  alt="A gif that scrolls through the right pane in service maps. It shows different graphs that correspond to the above paragraph."

Taken together, maps help you find the exact moment and place an incident appeared in your system.

  <Collapser
    id="omni-auto"
    title="Access automap and golden metrics"

  Our omnimap-powered tooltip displays a snapshot of a selected entity's health, including its [golden metrics](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/golden-metrics-entities-nerdgraph-api-tutorial), the environment the entity is in, and what team owns the entity.

If you notice something anomolous with your metrics, you can click **Map from this entity** to open up [automaps](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/automaps).

  When you hover your cursor over an entity, you'll get a snapshot of the entity's golden metrics.

## Distributed tracing trace maps [#trace]

Our trace maps page gives you two different views of all the requests made between services: maps view and waterfall view.

<img 
  title="Distributed tracing trace maps"
  alt="A screenshot of the trace maps page. At the top of the screenshot is map of the service calls. At the bottom of the screenshot is the waterfall view of the span information. "
  src={mapsTraceMaps}
/>

To get to trace maps:

1. Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) and click either **APM & services**, **Browser**, or **Mobile**. 
2. Click **Distributed tracing** under **Monitor**.
3. Choose a group under **Trace groups**.
4. Select the trace you'd like to start with from the table at the bottom of the page.

Trace maps display the requests made between your various services, scoped to a particular distributed trace. Using the legend above the map, you can track errors or anomalies in your entities, or view the entity that receives the most calls. This is particularly useful if you want to understand the context surrounding a trace before diving into the span-level details in waterfall view.

You'd choose to work with a trace map if you're interested in the details of every service and how that service connects to a particular chain of requests. With service maps, you get a map view that aggregates services of the same type together. On the other hand, a trace map will follow a specific request, display it visually, then lists each service out in the waterfall view, where you can view span metrics.

To get more details about using our different maps features, check out the following docs:

* [Introduction to service maps](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/introduction-service-maps)
* [Introduction to workloads](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/use-workloads#maps)
* [Automap for troubleshooting entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/automaps)
* [External services](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/external-services/external-services-intro)

To learn how map relationships are determined: 

* Applied intelligence: when you select an [issue](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/use-incident-intelligence/#issue-summary) in the UI, the map relies on [entity relationships](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-relationships-api-tutorial).
* [Distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/introduction-distributed-tracing): when you [view a trace in the UI](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui#trace-map), the map shows the relationships found in the trace.
