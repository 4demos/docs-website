Uninstrumented entities are automatically created by New Relic based on your telemetry. If we detect that one of your entities
is using another one which is currently not instrumented (for example, an Amazon RDS database) we'll show it in the
[service map](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/introduction-service-maps) so you are aware of it.
We will also display the relationship between this uninstrumented entity and the instrumented one, which in this example would be CALLS.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Note that uninstrumented entities are displayed slightly different than the instrumented ones. They are also hexagons but have a dotter border instead of a solid one.
</Callout>

You may want to instrument the uninstrumented entities. The process is really straightforard: just click on it, choose "instrument entity"
and we will present you a tutorial on how to perform the instrumentation depending on the type of entity. After this process is finished,
they will be displayed as usual -i.e. solid border- in the service map.
