metaDescription: New Relic creates uninstrumented entities which can be easily instrumented by the customer
---

import uninstrumentedEntityServiceMap from 'images/entities_screenshot_uninstrumented_entity.png'

New Relic can detect gaps on your instrumentation by analyzing your telemetry. These gaps can be databases, apps, or
basically any other type of entity. For example, one application could be storing information in a non-instrumented Amazon RDS database.

When that happens, such gaps are created in the form of an "uninstrumented" entity.  We'll show it in the
[service map](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/introduction-service-maps) so you are aware of it.
We will also display the relationship between this uninstrumented entity and the instrumented one, which in this example would be CALLS.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Note that uninstrumented entities are displayed slightly different than the instrumented ones. They're also hexagons
  but have a dotted border instead of a solid one.
</Callout>

Knowing what's not instrumented will increase your visibility over your platform and give you more control over it.
If you decide to instrument one uninstrumented entity, the process is straightforward: just click on it, choose "instrument"
and we will present you a tutorial on how to perform the instrumentation depending on the type of entity. After this process finishes,
they are displayed as usual -that is, solid border- in the service map.
