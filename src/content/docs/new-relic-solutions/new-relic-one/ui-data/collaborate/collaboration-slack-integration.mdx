While not everyone you work with is a New Relic user, most of your teammates are probably on Slack. Now you can discuss New Relic data with everyone and keep all insights synced between Slack and New Relic discussions.

Unlike many Slack integrations that just share an update to Slack in one-direction, conversation threads on New Relic are synced in both directions with threads on Slack. When you share a question, observation, or request for assistance from New Relic to Slack, your teammates on Slack—whether they are New Relic users themselves or not—can reply to the post on Slack and these replies will be brought back into the thread on New Relic. Likewise, replies added to the thread on New Relic will be added to the thread on Slack. This back and forth sync lets you include more people in the conversation, capture the discussion along with the context in New Relic, use data to inform decisions, and build institutional knowledge. All at the same time.

## Installation [#install]

The New Relic discussions Slack app is not yet in the Slack App Directory. Depending on your Slack workspace's **App Management Settings**, you may need the assistance of your Slack administrator for installation. 

If set, your Slack workspace admin may need to “Turn off “Only allow apps from the Slack App Directory,”, and likewise turn on “Allow members to request approval for apps.”. Then you can proceed with the authentication instructions below. Following those instructions will generate a request for an admin to approve the application after which, you can install the Slack app, and any settings temporarily changed can be restored.

## Authentication [#authenticate]

To use the New Relic Discussions Slack application you'll need your New Relic admin (or teammate with the Applied Intelligence Destination Create capability) to be the first to authenticate with Slack. roles to authenticate with Slack. This can be initiated by clicking on the “Sync to Slack” icon which will send you to slack.com to login to the workspace you'd like to use.

Once a workspace is configured any member of your New Relic organization will be able to authenticate to that workspace and share new discussion threads to Slack.

## Syncing to Slack [#sync]

After authenticating with a Slack workspace, when starting a new discussion thread (or adding a comment to a thread that hasn't previously been sync'd to Slack) simply check the “Sync to” checkbox and select the Slack channel you like to post the comment to.  

<img

  alt="A screenshot of a communication thread that will be synced with Slack."
  src={slack_channel}
/>

After submitting the comment the thread will have a “Synced to Slack” status indicator at the top letting all teammates know that any comments added to the thread on New Relic will also be added to the thread on Slack.

## Replying from Slack [#reply]

The first comment in a thread synced to Slack will be added to the channel selected on New Relic. The Slack post will include an “Open in New Relic” button providing quick navigation to the page and discussion on [one.newrelic.com](one.newrelic.com).

/>

The post will also include a message indicating the thread is synced to New Relic and that replies added to the thread on Slack will appear on New Relic.  Please note this means that regardless of the Slack channel's member list **replies will be visible by everyone in your New Relic organization on newrelic.com**.
