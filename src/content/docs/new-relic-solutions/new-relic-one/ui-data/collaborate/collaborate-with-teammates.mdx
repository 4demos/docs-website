The functionality described below is currently in preview. If you don't yet have access but would like to test the commenting and discussion functionality [please sign up here](https://one.newrelic.com/discussions).
</Callout>

We're making it easier to collaborate with your teammates by building discussion and commenting tools into New Relic. You can now add comments on any page. Our integrations with Slack, MS Teams (coming soon), and email let you share links and screenshots, and communicate with your teammates directly from the New Relic UI without switching applications. Our collaboration tools allow you to identify problems and find solutions in one place. Moving the discussion closer to your data streamlines your workflows, improves efficiency, and reduces MTTR.

## How it works [#collaborate]

We've integrated discussion tools directly into New Relic so you can: 

* **Start discussions in context at the source.** When you comment on a dashboard or an error in New Relic, that comment stays with that dashboard or error.
* **Sync discussions with Slack.**  With our Slack integration you share permalinks, screenshots, and comments to Slack in seconds. All teammates  can reply from Slack and discussions stay in sync, no matter where teammates contribute. [Learn more about the Slack integration](https://docs-preview.newrelic.com/docs/collaboration-slack-integration).
* **Create shared knowledge and history.** Collaborating within the New Relic platform will allow your team to build a searchable body of shared knowledge.
## Comment on any page [#comment-on-any-page]

On the global navigation, there's a new “add comment” icon on most pages. A green dot on the icon means there is actually an open discussion on the page. A gray dot means there are closed discussions that can perhaps answer new questions or help resolve current issues.

  alt="A screenshot of the UI that depicts commenting on a specific page."
  src={green_dot}
/>

If you want to ask a question, start a discussion, or share a permalink or screenshot to Slack, click the icon to open the comment panel. Type your comment and start a discussion on the page you're looking at. When you comment on a dashboard or an error in New Relic, that comment stays with your data. You don't need to spend time repeating information that can be seen at a glance, and everybody knows where to find an active, solution-oriented conversation.

## At-mention your teammates and notify by email [#at-mention-your-teammates]

Like other collaboration tools, when you at-mention (@) your teammates in a comment, they'll be notified by email. If you at-mention a teammate that isn't part of the preview or isn't using the new redesign, they won't have access to the discussion on New Relic. 

## Share permalinks and screenshots with Slack [#sync-with-slack]

Whenever you start a new discussion, you can sync it with Slack so you can collaborate with all your teammates, even those that aren't on New Relic.

Once the Slack app is configured and you are authenticated, select the Slack channel where you want your discussion synced. If you regularly use the same Slack channel it'll be prefilled so no extra clicks needed. From Slack, any teammate, even if they are not a New Relic user, can reply and their comment will be brought back into the thread on New Relic. Likewise subsequent replies added to the thread on New Relic will also be added to the thread on Slack.

[Learn more about the Slack integration](https://docs-preview.newrelic.com/docs/collaboration-slack-integration).

## Built-in screenshot sharing [#built-in-screenshots]

With a new integrated screenshot selection tool you can attach screenshots to your comments. Click the “screenshot” icon, select the portion of the screen you want, and submit your comment. 

## Close and re-open discussions [#close-reopen]

Once a question is answered or issue is resolved you can mark a discussion as “Closed” via the more actions menu on the discussion thread. Similar to a Jira ticket your team can still add comments to the discussion. This will not automatically re-open a discussion but if you need to you can manually do so the same way as closing.

  alt="A screenshot of the UI that depicts closing discussions."

## Follow and unfollow discussions [#follow-unfollow]

When you add a comment to a discussion or if you're at-mention you'll automatically be set to follow the discussion. This will be indicated by the bell icon on the discussion and on the discussions board. Following a discussion means you'll get email notifications and the Discussions board UMI (see next section) will increment when new comments are added to a discussion. If you want to unfollow a discussion that's also available via the more actions menu on the discussion (see screenshot in doc above).  Likewise, if there is a discussion you are interested in that you're not following but would like to, you can manually follow the same way. 

## The discussions board [#discussions-board]

<img
  title="Discussions board"
  alt="A screenshot of the UI that depiects the discussions board."
  src={collaboration_discussion_board_new}
/>

Go to the discussions board to see a complete history of the discussion threads in your organization. On the left nav, theUMI on the Discussions link indicates discussion threads you are following that have unread comments.. On the Discussions page, click a discussion thread to jump to the UI where that conversation is happening.

We know that your team uses a wide variety of tools to communicate but when discussions are spread across platforms and teams, it is easy to lose institutional knowledge. You can now use the discussion board to find active discussions as well as search the archive of shared knowledge. Our discussion board helps you find answers to questions and research how issues and problems were solved in the past.

## Who can see your discussions [#visibility]

All users in an account, and this applies to specific accounts in a multi-account organization, can see all discussions in that account. The Discussions page shows all discussions tied to data in accounts you are in, but not discussions tied to accounts you are not in.  (Keep in mind this applies to replies synced to New Relic from Slack, which may be composed in a small private channel on Slack, but will be viewable by all New Relic users in the account on New Relic.)
