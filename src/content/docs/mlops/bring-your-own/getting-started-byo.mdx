This is a guide to getting started with New Relic’s bring your own data. You’ll learn how to install, run and experiment with BYOD and start monitoring  the performance of your Machine Learning models.


## Quick start [#quick-start]
Using Bring your own data makes it easy to monitor your ML models in 3 main steps:

```python
# STEP 1: Initialize the monitoring
ml_monitor = MLPerformanceMonitoring(...)

# STEP 2: Add your algorithm
y = my_model.predict(X)

# STEP 3: Record your data
ml_monitor.record_inference_data(X, y)
```

Use this example in [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/newrelic-experimental/ml-performance-monitoring/blob/main/examples/XGBoost_on_Boston_housing_prices_dataset.ipynb) and easily try an end-to-end example of model monitoring.


## Installation [#installation]
Installation is straightforward, similar to any python library

```python
pip install git+https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/ml-performance-monitoring.git
```


## Implementation [#implementation]
This guide will take you step by step for everything needed to start monitoring your Machine Learning models

**STEP 1: Set Your Environment Variable**
[Get your License key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher) (also referenced as `ingest - license`) and set it as environment variable: `NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY`. [Click here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key) for more details and instructions.
Are you reporting data to the New Relic EU region? click [here](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/ml-performance-monitoring#eu-account-users) for more instructions.

**STEP 2: Import package**
```python
from ml_performance_monitoring.monitor import MLPerformanceMonitoring
```

**STEP 3: Create model monitor**
```python
metadata = {"environment": "notebook"}
model_version = "1.0"
features_columns, labels_columns = (
    ["feature_1", "feature_2", "feature_3", "feature_4"],
    ["target"],
)

ml_monitor = MLPerformanceMonitoring(
    insert_key=None,  # set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY or send your insert key here
    model_name="My stunning model",
    metadata=metadata,
    features_columns=features_columns,
    labels_columns=labels_columns,
    label_type="numeric",
    model_version=model_version
)
```

**STEP 4: Do your thing**
```python
y = my_model.predict(X)
```

**STEP 5: Record**
```python
ml_performence_monitor_model.record_inference_data(X, y)
```

**STEP 6: Monitor and alert**
Done! Check your application in the New Relic UI to see the real time data.
 

## Examples [#examples]
We created these notebooks in Google colab so you can try them out:
  1. Try out an XGBoost model on Boston housing prices dataset. Open in colab.
  2. Try out how to simulate 24 hours of model inference data using New Relic MLOps. Open in colab


## EU Account Users [#EU-account-users]
If you are using an EU account, send it as a parameter at the MLPerformanceMonitoring call if your environment variable is not set:
  * `EVENT_CLIENT_HOST and METRIC_CLIENT_HOST`
    * US region account (default) -
      * `EVENT_CLIENT_HOST`: insights-collector.newrelic.com
      * `METRIC_CLIENT_HOST`: metric-api.newrelic.com
    * EU region account -
      * `EVENT_CLIENT_HOST`: insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net
      * `METRIC_CLIENT_HOST`: metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1
It can also be sent as parameters at the MLPerformanceMonitoring call.
