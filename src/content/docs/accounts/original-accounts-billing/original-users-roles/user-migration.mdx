On July 30 2020, we released a new and improved account/user model called the New Relic One user model. Our new model was mainly available to organizations that signed up for a new New Relic account on or after July 30 2020, while our existing customers remained on our original user model. The newer model offers a much simpler, more efficient way to manage your users and what they have access to in your New Relic organization ([learn more about the benefits of the new model](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/user-management-and-access-security/)). 

Starting April 12, 2021, we’re allowing some of our original-model customers to self-serve and migrate their original model users (sometimes called “v1 users”) to the new model (aka, to become “v2 users”). When you use our migration wizard to complete that process, your organization and users will be on the New Relic One user model and you’ll have [new procedures for managing your users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-managing-users/). 

## Requirements [#requirements]

The easiest way to see if you have access to the user migration wizard is to check if it’s visible in the UI.

Factors affecting access to the migration wizard: 
* Must have the [Owner role](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#roles). 
* This is **not** available for some organizations that have a more complex account structure. If the migration wizard is not available and you wish to migrate your users to the new model, contact your New Relic account representative. 

## Before beginning [#before-beginning]

The more complex your organization is, the more it may help you to first understand our [new user management concepts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts). A brief summary: 
* Users reside within a container known as an “authentication domain,” which governs how those users are added to New Relic (manually via the UI versus automatically via a SCIM-based identity service provider, like Okta), and how they log in (manually with email/password versus using SAML SSO), and other settings. Typically organizations have only one or two authentication domains: one with the default manual settings and one for the more automatic methods.  
* Users can be assigned to one or more groups (for example, our default **Admin** group or a custom group like **Contractors**). For large organizations, users are often in multiple groups. 
* When you want to add new groups, or give groups access to more accounts, you must create an access grant. This assigns a group access to: 1) a specific role and 2) a specific account. For example, you may give a Contractors group access to our default All product admin role on one or more of your accounts, or give that group a custom role (a role being a custom set of [capabilities](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts)). 

The more complex your organization is, the more it may help you to first plan out how your user groups and access grants will be structured. 


## Use the user migration wizard [#find]

If you meet [the requirements](#requirements), you can use the wizard. To start using the migration wizard: 

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click **Apps** in the top navigation and then click the **User migration walkthrough** app.
2. Optional: if you have problems, see [Tips].

Once your users are migrated to the new model, you can find and manage them by clicking the account dropdown, clicking **Administration**, and using these UI pages: 

* **User management**: use this to view and add users, change their type (basic vs full), change their group, and approve user upgrade requests. 
* **Organization and access**: use this to create access grants (granting groups access to roles and accounts), and configure authentication domains (SAML SSO settings and SCIM settings, and more). 

For more about these tools, see the [new user management docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-managing-users/).

## Tips on using the migration wizard (#tips)

The migration wizard is meant to have all the context you need to complete the migration process but here are some tips for potential areas of confusion: 

* Guided setup vs automatic setup: Simple organizations with few users and few accounts, and who have little need for their users to have separate roles or separate account access, may decide to choose the automatic setup. If you require some customization of user access, or if your New Relic users use SAML SSO to sign in or are managed via an identity service provider (like Azure AD or Okta), you should use the guided setup. 
* Once an account’s Owner does the initial step in the wizard of migrating admins, those admins are then able to access and complete the remainder of the migration wizard. 
* The migration wizard gives you an option to download a full list of your existing original user model users (aka v1 users) before choosing to migrate users. This is recommended because that file can serve as a useful reference tool and, in case it’s needed, as a backup file. 
* To check on the status of your user migration, you can go to the [**User management** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#where) to see which users are on the new model. 
* After migration, some users may end up with access to logins for both an original model account and a new model account, both associated with a single email address. This is because our original user model allowed a user, with a single login, to access data from multiple organizations (a common scenario for contractors, for example). But the new user model gives more user control to organizations, and this means that such a user would now require a different login for each organization. If a user previously had access that spanned multiple organizations, they’ll retain an original user record until migration is completed for all associated organizations. One indicator of this situation is that, on login, the UI asks them to [verify their email](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/troubleshoot-new-relics-password-email-address-login-problems/#verify-email) to see all associated accounts, and shows them an “original” account (see below image).

If your email address is associated with multiple logins, you can verify your email to see those accounts. In the example above, the “Original New Relic account” refers to that user record being on the older, original account/user model.
