metaDescription: How to add accounts to your New Relic organization. 
---

How you add accounts to your New Relic organization depends on the type of [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models) your users are on:

* New Relic One user model: here are some relevant docs: 
  * [Add and rename accounts via our NerdGraph API.](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/manage-accounts-nerdgraph)
  * To learn about the structure of your New Relic organization, see [Organization structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure). 
* Original user model: see [Add accounts](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/parent-child-account-structure/#creating). 


Want to determine which you're on? See [Determine user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models/#determine-user-model).
