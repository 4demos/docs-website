When someone signs up for New Relic, a New Relic organization is created. A New Relic organization can have multiple accounts. 

We track users based on email address: an organization might add the same user to multiple accounts. As long as that user has the same email address, they are counted as one user. For more on user billing, see [User billing calculations]. 

There are several ways to log in to New Relic: 

* Email and password: This is the default login method. This includes manually inputting an email and password, or using your Google account. 
* Single sign-on: For identity provider login options, see [Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim).
