There are several ways a New Relic user can log into a New Relic organization: 

* Email and password: This is the default login method. This includes manually inputting an email and password, or [logging in using Google](#login-options).
* Single sign-on: For identity provider login options, see [Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim). 

Having trouble logging in? See [Login troubleshooting](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/troubleshoot-new-relics-password-email-address-login-problems/).

For docs on controlling how users log in, see [Authentication domains](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more).

## Tracking of users via email address [#email]

A New Relic organization can add a user to multiple accounts in the organization. As long as that user has the same email address, for the purposes of billing, they're counted as a single user. For more on user billing, see [User billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing).
