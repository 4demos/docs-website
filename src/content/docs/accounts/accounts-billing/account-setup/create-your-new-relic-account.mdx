At New Relic, our mission is to help you create more perfect software. So we give you **free access** to our observability platform, **forever**. For [free](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#free), you can ingest up to 100 GBs per month, and have one [full platform user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) and **unlimited** basic users.

That's right. You can use New Relic free, forever, as long as you stay within the free limits. And we give you the tools to [manage your data ingest](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-your-data) to ensure you are getting the most from your data.
