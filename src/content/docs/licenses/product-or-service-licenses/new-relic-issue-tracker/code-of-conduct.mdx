We expect all our New Relic Issue Tracker  participants to agree to follow the behaviors and guidelines in this Code Of Conduct.

The Issue Tracker is used for bug and feature requests that New Relic users can track publicly. Other questions, requests, and discussions may be appropriate for one of our other public forums. Contributions to the [New Relic Community Library](https://opensource.newrelic.com/projects/newrelic/nr1-community) are subject to our [Community Terms](https://newrelic.com/termsandconditions/communityterms#:~:text=THE%20COMMUNITY%20AND%20ALL%20CONTENT,PURPOSE%2C%20ACCURACY%2C%20OR%20NONINFRINGEMENT) and the [Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.newrelic.com/code-of-conduct/). Discussions in [New Relic Explorers Hub](https://newrelic.com/termsandconditions/communityterms#:~:text=THE%20COMMUNITY%20AND%20ALL%20CONTENT,PURPOSE%2C%20ACCURACY%2C%20OR%20NONINFRINGEMENT) are subject to our Community Terms and the [Explorers Hub Code of Conduct](https://discuss.newrelic.com/guidelines). 

## Participating in the New Relic Issue Tracker

The New Relic Issue Tracker is a place to publicly report a “Bug” or submit a “Feature Request.” Our goal with the Issue Tracker is to create an information-filled resource where New Relic users can report or search for identified bugs or desired features within New Relic. With the Issue Tracker, users can search to see if tickets for the issues or features they are interested in already exist and can have visibility as to the status of those tickets. Public interest and visibility lends to the accountability of New Relic to (a) keep these requests up to date and (b) remain transparent as to our efforts to address the request or report. 

While maintaining transparency and providing resources for these types of requests, New Relic also wants to ensure that its users feel welcome to participate in a resourceful environment that is free from inappropriate behavior and content. 

To meet these goals, New Relic has created these Issue Tracker guidelines for all members to follow. These Issue Tracker guidelines are important, and will be enforced by New Relic moderators. They are also a work in progress, and may evolve as the Issue Tracker grows. Finally, the guidelines are not exhaustive, so please act in good faith and follow the spirit of the guidelines at all times.

In the Issue Tracker, we hope to foster an environment that encourages participants to choose actions that reflect New Relic’s values:

* Bold: Take risks to deliver ground-breaking innovation. Be courageous.
* Authentic: Be genuine, honest, and inclusive. You can be yourself at work.
* Accountable: Take pride in what you do and hold yourself to high standards. Deliver on your commitments.
* Passionate: Be inspired and inspire others. Make a difference.
* Connected: Build trusted, personal connections with each other. We are a team.

If New Relic staff decide that your behavior violates the spirit of these guidelines, we may remove your content or disable your use of the Issue Tracker at any time, with or without notice.

Though we will actively moderate the Issue Tracker, you may see objectionable content before it is taken down. Please report any problematic behavior per our [Issue Tracker Reporting Guidelines](/docs/licenses/product-or-service-licenses/new-relic-issue-tracker/reporting-guidelines).

## Support and Other Requests 

The primary goal for the Issue Tracker is to allow New Relic customers to submit bug reports and Feature Requests so that the customer and public can track progress and improvements. It is not an appropriate platform for support requests, general troubleshooting, or open source projects.

If you are in need of New Relic support or troubleshooting for the New Relic observability platform, please seek support through your [New Relic Support Plan](/docs/licenses/license-information/general-usage-licenses/global-technical-support-offerings/) or visit [New Relic Explorers Hub](https://discuss.newrelic.com). If you are contributing to a New Relic open source project, please visit our [New Relic Community Library](https://opensource.newrelic.com/projects/newrelic/nr1-community).
