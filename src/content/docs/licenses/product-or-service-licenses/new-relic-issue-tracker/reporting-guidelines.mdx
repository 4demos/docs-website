## How do I report a violation?

If you believe someone is violating the Issue Tracker [Code of Conduct](/docs/licenses/product-or-service-licenses/new-relic-issue-tracker/code-of-conduct) or [Terms of Use](/docs/licenses/product-or-service-licenses/new-relic-issue-tracker/terms-of-use), we ask that you report it to the New Relic Issue Tracker Moderator by tagging @moderator in a private comment on the ticket you believe violates the Code of Conduct. All reports will be kept confidential to the extent possible.

<Callout variant="important">
If you believe the violation involves possible copyright infringement, please instead follow the reporting procedure outlined in our [DMCA Policy](https://newrelic.com/termsandconditions/dmca).
</Callout>  

If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by the Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports where we decide to take no action, rather than miss a report of an actual violation. We do not look negatively on you if we find the incident is not a violation. And knowing about incidents that are not violations, or that happen outside our spaces, can also help us to improve the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.

In your report, please include information that will help us start an investigation, such as:

* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
* A description of the content you believe violates the Issue Tracker Code of Conduct or Terms of Use. 
* If the content is no longer visible, your account of what occurred. 
* Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
* If you believe this incident is ongoing.
* Any other information you believe we should have.

## What happens after I file a report?

All reports filed via private comment in the New Relic Issue Tracker will be reviewed by New Relic’s designated Moderator.

We will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response. We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reports, which may range from not taking action to direct actions, such as permanently banning your use of the Issue Tracker. We may provide the details of the report to the accused user. The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report supplied to the accused.

New Relic may take action without notice to the accused, especially in potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing harassment or threats to anyone’s safety. 

We encourage New Relic employees to report any misconduct they may experience to Human Resources or to any senior manager through the reporting process outlined in our anti-harassment policy and training.
