[New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one-overview) provides unified access to all the [entities](/docs/what-are-new-relic-entities) you monitor with New Relic. [Tags](/docs/using-tags) are used to organize and group all your entities in a way that's useful for troubleshooting and understanding your environment. To add, delete, or modify your tags, use the [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](/docs/apis/graphql-api/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-graphql-api). NerdGraph allows you to tag your entities with a key and an associated list of values.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also use NerdGraph to [query entities](/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/use-new-relic-graphql-api-query-entities).
</Callout>

## Read tags for an entity [#read-tags]

To construct these queries and see responses:

1. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at [https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).
2. Use [`entitySearch()`](/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/use-new-relic-graphql-api-query-entities#search-entity) to find the entity and then fetch its tags.
3. Use NerdGraph's tag API to read the existing tags and their values.

In this example, our entity is a browser app called `Cookie Checkout`:

```
{
  actor {
    entitySearch(query: "name like 'Cookie Checkout'") {
      results {
        entities {
          tags {
            key
            values
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The actual values vary depending on your data. Use the [New Relic GraphiQL explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) to experiment with queries.

## Add tags for an entity [#add-tags]

To add new tags for an entity:

1. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at [https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).
2. Use [`entitySearch()`](/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/use-new-relic-graphql-api-query-entities#search-entity) to locate the GUID for the entity you want to tag.
3. Use the `taggingAddTagsToEntity` mutation to add a tag with a value to the entity.

In this example, we have a browser application called `Cookie Checkout` owned by a UI team. We want to add a `team` tag with a `ui` value to this instance. Once the tag is added, we can filter by the tag `team:ui` and find the `Cookie Checkout` app in the New Relic One UI.

```
mutation {
    taggingAddTagsToEntity(
        guid: "ENTITY_GUID",
        tags: { key: "team", values: ["ui"]}) {
            errors {
                message
            }
        }
}
```

## Remove a tag from an entity [#delete-entity-tag]

To delete a tag and all of its associated values from an entity:

1. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at [https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).
2. Use [`entitySearch()`](/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/use-new-relic-graphql-api-query-entities#search-entity) to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove.
3. Use the `taggingDeleteTagFromEntity` mutation.

The following example mutation removes the `team` tag from an entity:

```
mutation {
    taggingDeleteTagFromEntity(
        guid: "ENTITY_GUID",
        tagKeys: ["team"]) {
            errors {
                message
            }
        }
}
```

## Delete specific tag values for an entity [#delete-specific-tag]

Instead of deleting an entire tag and all of its values, you can delete a single tag value.

1. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at [https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).
2. Use [`entitySearch()`](/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/use-new-relic-graphql-api-query-entities#search-entity) to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove.
3. Use the `taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity` mutation.

The following example mutation deletes the `ui` value from the `tag` key:

```
mutation {
    taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity(
        guid: "ENTITY_GUID",
        tagValues: [{key: "team" value: "ui"}]) {
            errors {
                message
            }
        }
}
```

Because `tagValues` is an array, you can delete multiple specific values from a single entity in one mutation.

## Replace all tag values for an entity [#replace-tag-values]

To replace all the existing values for a tag with new ones:

1. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at [https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).
2. Use [`entitySearch()`](/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/use-new-relic-graphql-api-query-entities#search-entity) to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove.
3. Use the `taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity` mutation.

In this example, the `Cookie Checkout` browser application was transferred from the `ui` team to the `cookie-dev` team. You can replace the tag values for `team` with the following mutation:

```
mutation {
    taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity(
        guid: "ENTITY_GUID",
        tags: {key: "team" values: ["cookie-dev"]}) {
            errors {
                message
            }
        }
}
```
