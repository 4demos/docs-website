This document contains instructions for installing the .NET agent to monitor an ASP.NET Core application. These are additional caveats and instructions meant to supplement the standard install procedures ([Windows](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/install-net-agent-windows) \| [Linux](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/install-net-agent-linux)).

## For ASP.NET Core apps targeting .NET Core [#core-targeting-core]

For ASP.NET Core apps targeting .NET Core that are hosted in IIS, New Relic instruments these out-of-the-box. For applications **not** using IIS, you will follow the standard install procedures ([Windows](/docs/agents/net-agent/other-installation/install-net-agent-aspnet-core-targeting-net-framework-windows) \| [Linux](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/install-net-agent-linux)) but you must also enable the agent for your application and, if monitoring doesn't happen automatically, set up custom instrumentation:

* Enabling your app: See instructions [for Windows](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/install-net-agent-windows#enabling-the-agent) and [for Linux](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/install-net-agent-linux#enable-agent).
* Custom instrumentation: If you're not using Kestral, or if instrumentation doesn't happen by default for some other reason, you must [custom instrument your app](/docs/agents/net-agent/custom-instrumentation/introduction-net-custom-instrumentation).

## For ASP.NET Core applications targeting .NET Framework [#core-targeting-framework]

For applications not hosted in IIS, or that are ASP.NET Core apps targeting .NET Framework, you will follow the [standard install procedure for Windows](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/install-net-agent-windows#msi) but in addition you must explicitly [enable the agent using these instructions](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/install-net-agent-windows#enabling-the-agent).
