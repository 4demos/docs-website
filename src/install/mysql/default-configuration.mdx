Edit the `mysql-config.yml` configuration file. An integration's YAML configuration file is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. The options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like `interval`, `timeout`, or `inventory_source`. To read all about these common settings refer to our [configuration format standards](/docs/create-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-newer-configuration-format/#configuration-basics).
