- Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher.
  <Callout variant="important">
    For MySQL v8.0 and higher, we don't support the following metrics: `db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes`, `db.qCacheHitRatio`, and `db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond`.
  </Callout>

- We require TLS version 1.2 or higher, with TLS authentication.
- If your MySQL instance isn't running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic) on a Linux or Windows OS host, or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed.
