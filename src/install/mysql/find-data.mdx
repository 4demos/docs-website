After you've configured and installed the integration, you can start monitoring:

* Data from this service, which is reported to an [integration dashboard](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-dashboards/#nrql).
* Metrics are attached to the `MysqlSample` [event type](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic). You can [query this data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

For more on how to find and use your data, see how to [understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).
