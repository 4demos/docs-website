You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. To integrate the Python agent with your app, you can run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command, or you can use the Python agent API.

<Callout variant="important">
  The Python agent does not support any versions of Tornado below 6.0.

### Automatic initialization with admin script [#wrapper-script]

You can use the recommended [admin script integration method](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation#integration), provided you start your app with `python app.py` and use the Tornado async interface.
The admin script was included when you installed the Python agent.

Here's an example:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=<var>path/to/</var>newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-python app.py
```

Manual integration in your app code is allowed but not recommended. See [Manual integration instructions](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-integration#manual-integration) for more information.

### Event loop diagnostic support [#event-loops]

The Python agent supports asyncio event loop diagnostics. See [Python event loop diagnostics](/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/python-event-loop-diagnostics) for more information.
