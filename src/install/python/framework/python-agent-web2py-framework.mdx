You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. To integrate the Python agent with your app, you can run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command.

Choose the Web2py setup you use from the list below:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="running-with-runweb2py"
    title="Runweb2py command"
  >
    If you run your web application using the **runweb2py** command, use the following command:

    ```
    NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=<var>/some/path/</var>newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program runweb2py
    ```

    `newrelic-admin` is a script that wraps your application startup, so that the agent can monitor your application's major functions. For more on running the wrapper script, see [Running the wrapper script](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation#integration).

  <Collapser

    title="Apache/mod_wsgi"

    When using Apache/mod_wsgi, you **must** manually insert code in the WSGI script file you are using in order to initialize the Python agent. For more info, see [our mod_wsgi documentation](/docs/python/python-agent-and-mod_wsgi).

    For information on using Gunicorn with the agent, see [Python agent and Gunicorn documentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-mechanisms/python-agent-and-gunicorn).
