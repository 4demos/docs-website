You can use the Python agent with AJP in conjunction with [flup](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flup).

You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. To integrate the Python agent with your app, run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command.

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program YOUR_COMMAND_OPTIONS
```
