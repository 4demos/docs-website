You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. Here are the two options:

* If you are using a supported framework, you'll use the `newrelic-admin` script when you start your app.
* If you're not using a supported framework, or if you're using an unsupported one, you'll insert some code in your app to manually initialize the agent.
