You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. To integrate the Python agent with your app, you can run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command.

### Admin script integration method (recommended) [#integrated-server]

The admin script integration method will work if the `paste.httpserver.serve()` API function is used directly. The admin script was included when you installed the Python agent.

Here's an example:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program YOUR_COMMAND_OPTIONS
```

### Using PasteDeploy

If rather than manually incorporating the call to startup the Paste HTTP server in your application code, you are using PasteDeploy with a configuration similar to:

```
[server:main]
use = egg:Paste#http
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 8080
```

all you instead need to do to start up your WSGI application is wrap the running of the `paster` command:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program paster serve production.ini
