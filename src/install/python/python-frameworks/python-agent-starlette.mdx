You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. To integrate the Python agent with your app, you can run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command if using Python agent **version 5.22.0.151** or higher, or you can use the Python agent API. There are no specific steps you need to take to integrate with Starlette, so skip straight to the server-specific instructions in the next step.

  If you have difficulty with this automatic initialzation, you can also try our manual instrumentation steps. To get those instructions, go back to the first question and select **Unsupported ASGI framework**.
