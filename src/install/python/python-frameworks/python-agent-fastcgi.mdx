You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. To integrate the Python agent with your app, you can run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command.

You can use the Python agent with FastCGI in conjunction with [flup](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flup).

For FastCGI, the web application is always managed as an external process. If you have integrated the FastCGI/WSGI adapter for flup, as in:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
from fcgi import WSGIServer

def application(environ, start_response):
    status = '200 OK'
    output = 'Hello World!'

    response_headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain'),
                        ('Content-Length', str(len(output)))]
    start_response(status, response_headers)

    return [output]

ret = WSGIServer(application).run()
```

And, if you are starting your FastCGI process as a Python script directly with Python as `python app.py`, instead run:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program python app.py
```

  If you have difficulty with this automatic initialzation, you can also try our manual instrumentation steps. To get those instructions, go back to the first question and select **Unsupported WSGI framework**.
