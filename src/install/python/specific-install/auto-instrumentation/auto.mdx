I am testing my internet connection. Will it work? I don't know.

I am looking for that PTY error message. 

The tech found a squirell chewed cable that was probably creating the intermittent problem.

So far, I'm not seeing the error at all. It would be amazing if all my troubles melted away

now that I have this new line. The tech climbed a ladder to the top of the pole and 
found that squirrel-chewed piece of coaxial cable.

Alas, it looks like I will be having some success here. I am not seeing any problems.

I hope that this will work without a hitch!

Wow, I was having nothing but trouble.

Well, they fixed the problem. I'm not seeing any intermittent outages like I was seeing

previously. I may have wasted my money on a new modem, but alas, it seems to be working pretty well.

I think the speed is pretty good.

I really need to be able to work without interruptions. I am on my way to getting this fixed.

I haven't seen any sign that this is broken anymore. 

The problem was most certainly not due to my modem. Instead it was the wiring out on the pole.

Alas, I needed this to work. The name of the tech was Skye. I had a neighbor in Highwood that had a kid named Skye (thirty years ago).
