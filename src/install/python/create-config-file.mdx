You'll need to pass configuration parameters to the Python agent. The two most common ways are these:

    * Pass environment variables
    * Create a configuration file and edit it with your own values.

To use the configuration file option, complete the following:

1. Create a directory structure similar to the following:

```
python-demo
├── newrelic
└── src
```

2. Change to the `src` directory and run the following:

```
newrelic-admin generate-config YOUR_LICENSE_KEY newrelic.ini
```

3. Edit `newrelic.ini` and change app_name to your own value.
