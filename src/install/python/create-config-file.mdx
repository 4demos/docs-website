The Python agent needs some basic configurations to get started. Here are two common ways to set these:

### Use a configuration file [#configuration-file]

To create a configuration file:

1. Go to the directory where your Python app is located and run the following:

```
newrelic-admin generate-config YOUR_LICENSE_KEY newrelic.ini
```

2. Edit your `newrelic.ini` and insert values for the following:

    ```
    ...
    license_key = INSERT_YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
    ...
    app_name = INSERT_YOUR_APP_NAME
    ...
    ```

### Use environment variables [#env-vars]

Create the following environment variables, inserting your license key and app name:

```
export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=INSERT_YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
export NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=INSERT_YOUR_APP_NAME
```
