You can use the Python agent with AJP in conjunction with [flup](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flup).

You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. To integrate the Python agent with your app, run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command. The admin script was included when you downloaded the Python agent, and you can use a command like this:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program YOUR_COMMAND_OPTIONS
```

  If you have difficulty with this automatic initialzation, you can also try our manual instrumentation steps. To get those instructions, go back to the first question and select **Unsupported WSGI framework**.
