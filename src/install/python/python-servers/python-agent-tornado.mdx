You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. To integrate the Python agent with your app, you can run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command, or you can use the Python agent [API](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/guide-using-python-agent-api/).

<Callout variant="important">
  The Python agent does not support any versions of Tornado below 6.0.
</Callout>

You can use the recommended admin script integration method, provided you start your app with `python app.py` and use the Tornado async interface. The admin script was included when you downloaded the Python agent, and you can use a command like this:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=<var>path/to/</var>newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-python app.py
```

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you have difficulty with this automatic initialzation, you can also try our manual instrumentation steps. To get those instructions, go back to the first question and select **Unsupported WSGI framework**.
