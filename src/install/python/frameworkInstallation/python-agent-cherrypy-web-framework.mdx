This documentation contains requirements and tips for integrating the Python agent with an app that uses the [CherryPy WSGI server](http://docs.cherrypy.org/). For general install instructions, go to [Install the Python agent](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation).

## Admin script integration method [#integrated-server]

You can use the recommended admin script integration method if the `CherryPyWSGIServer` API function is used directly. The recommended admin script method is described in the general [installation instructions](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation#integration).

## Using PasteDeploy [#using-paste-deploy]

If rather than manually integrating the call to startup the CherryPy WSGI server in your application code, you are using PasteDeploy with a configuration similar to:

```
[server:main]
use = egg:PasteScript#cherrypy
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 8080
```

all you instead need to do to start up your WSGI application is wrap the running of the `paster` command:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program paster serve production.ini
```
