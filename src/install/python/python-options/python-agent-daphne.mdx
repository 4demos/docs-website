You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. To integrate the Python agent with your app, you can run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command, or you can use the Python agent API.

### Automatic initialization with admin script (recommended) [#wrapper-script]

If you start your app with `daphne path_to_app:my_app` and use our Python agent **version 8.0.0.179** or higher, you can use the recommended admin script integration method. The admin script was included when you installed the Python agent.

Here's an example:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=<var>path/to/</var>newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program daphne path_to_app:my_app
```

  If you have difficulty with this automatic initialzation, you can also try our manual instrumentation steps. To get those instructions, go back to the first question and select **Unsupported WSGI framework**.
