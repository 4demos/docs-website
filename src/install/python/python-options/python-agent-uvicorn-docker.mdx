Here are some instructions for doing automatic initialization with Uvicorn and `docker run`. If you are using another supported framework with Docker, you'll need to adjust your syntax.

### A. Create the directory structure [#create-directories]

You'll need to insert some files in the directory structure for your application. To prepare for that, you might create a structure similar to this:

```
python-docker
├── newrelic
│   └── Dockerfile
└── src
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── your_app.py
    ├── newrelic.ini
    └── requirements.txt
```

### B. Insert the New Relic configuration file [#config-file]

In the previous steps, you created a `newrelic.ini` configuration file that contains your license key and app name.

Insert this configuration in the same directory as your Python app.

### C. Create the requirements file [#requirements-file]

Create `requirements.txt` (the list of dependencies for Python) by running this command in the directory where your application resides:

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### D. Create the base container (New Relic) [#base-container]

This is the container that runs the agent.

1. In the directory for the New Relic agent (for example, `newrelic`), create this Dockerfile for the base container (the file name is just `Dockerfile`):

    ```
    FROM python:3.9.14-alpine3.16

    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir newrelic

    ENTRYPOINT ["newrelic-admin", "run-program"]
    ```

2. Create the container with this command:

    ```
    docker build -t python_newrelic:latest .
    ```

3. Change to the directory where your app is located (for example, src)

### E. Create a container for your app

This is the container that will hold your application. It will work in concert with the base container. Note that it pulls in the base container in the `FROM`.

1. Create the Dockerfile for your app in the same directory as your Python app.

    * Change `WORKDIR` to match your directory structure.
    * For the `CMD` line, replace the uvicorn example with the syntax from the previous step.

    ```
    FROM python_newrelic:latest

    RUN apk add --no-cache bzip2-dev \
            coreutils \
            gcc \
            libc-dev \
            libffi-dev \
            libressl-dev \
            linux-headers

        WORKDIR INSERT_THE_PATH_TO_YOUR_PYTHON_APP

        COPY requirements.txt ./
        RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

        COPY . .

        EXPOSE 8000

        CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
    ```

2. In the directory with your Dockerfile and your app, build the container with this command:

    ```
	docker build -t my_python_api .
    ```

### F. Run the containers [#run-container]

Once you have the base New Relic container and a container made for your app, you can run both with this command:

```
docker run \
-e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=INSERT_YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \
-e NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME="docker-fastapi-example" \
-p 8000:8000 -it --rm --name INSERT_NAME_TO_DISPLAY_IN_DOCKER INSERT_A_SECONDARY_NAME_FOR_YOUR_APP
```

Note the following about this command:

* You need to insert your license key (the key–not the key ID)
* For the New Relic app name, insert the app name that's in `newrelic.ini`. This will show up in the UI.
* The -p is for the port: It tells the container to pass port 8000 to your computer's port 8000. Change if necessary.
