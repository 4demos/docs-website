You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. To integrate the Python agent with your app, you can run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command.

The Python agent provides support for the [Waitress](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/waitress) WSGI server. This includes automatically instrumenting the WSGI application entry point supplied to the Waitress server. The automatic instrumentation will work if the `waitress.serve()` API function is used directly, or if `egg:waitress#main` is specified as the server to use when starting up the web application using PasteDeploy.

### Admin script integration method (recommended) [#integrated-server]

You can use the recommended admin script integration method. The admin script was included when you installed the Python agent.

Here's an example:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program YOUR_COMMAND_OPTIONS
```

### Admin script with PasteDeploy [#paste]

Instead of manually integrating the call to startup the Waitress WSGI server in your application code, you might be using PasteDeploy with a configuration file like the following:

```
[server:main]
use = egg:waitress#main
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 8080
```

When you start up your WSGI application, wrap the running of the `paster` command:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program paster serve production.ini
```

  If you have difficulty with this automatic initialzation, you can also try our manual instrumentation steps. To get those instructions, go back to the first question and select **Unsupported WSGI framework**.
