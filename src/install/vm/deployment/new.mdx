## Prerequisites

- A New Relic [license key](/docs/accounts-partnerships/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key) for the account you want to report data to.
- Organization/Repository administration access to your GitHub account(s)
    - Organization webhooks are strongly recommended. It’s much easier to administer a single webhook per org than to create separate rules for each repository.

## Create the webhook

To complete the webhook you need:

1. From your GitHub organization or repository main page, select **Settings** then select **Webhooks** in the left nav and finally **Add webhook** in the top right of the page.
2. Set the following options:
    - Set **Payload URL** to `https://security-ingest-processor.service.newrelic.com/v1/security/webhooks/dependabot?Api-Key=<NewRelicIngestKey>`
    - Set **Content Type** to `application/json`
    - Leave **Secret** blank
    - Set **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?** To ‘Let me select individual events`.
3. Select **Repository vulnerability alerts** in the list of events.
4. Click **Add webhook**

Confirm you see a green check mark by the new webhook.

Whenever Dependabot finds a new vulnerability, it will forward it to New Relic through the new webhook. You can find your new data in Logs, the vulnerability management views, and by querying your data.
