Dependabot is a GitHub service that provides vulnerability analysis of your software dependencies. You can import Dependabot findings into New Relic to achieve a single, unified view of vulnerabilities. 

There are two components to the Dependabot â†’ New Relic integration:

- Webhook - forward newly detected vulnerabilities to New Relic in realtime, as they are detected

- Bulk import - load previously detected vulnerabilities into New Relic so you have a complete view of issues detected before you enabled the webhook
