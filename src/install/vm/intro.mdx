Dependabot is a GitHub service that provides vulnerability analysis of your software dependencies. You can import Dependabot findings into New Relic to achieve a single, unified view of vulnerabilities.  

After completion of these steps, you will see new vulnerabilities detected by Dependabot in your New Relic account in real time and will be able to build out analytics dashboards and enable alerts on newly detected issues.

You have two options when sending Dependabot data:

- Send newly detected vulnerabilities in realtime to New Relic with a webhook
- Import previously detected vulnerabilities into New Relic through a bulk import.

When first enabling your webhook, we recommend combining it with a bulk import to ensure data integrity of historical vulnerabilities.
