You can set up and configure a role and incorporate that role into your playbook with [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html). 

See our [manual Ansible installation overview](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/additional-installation/install-new-relic-java-agent-ansible) to get started. If you hit a blocker, file an issue in our [Java agent Ansible repo](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent-ansible-role).
