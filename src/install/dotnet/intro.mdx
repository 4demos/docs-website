New Relic supports the most popular .NET application implementations. Once installed, our .NET APM agent monitors your app's performance and gives you insight into that performance. Want more context? See our [intro to APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm).

If you haven't already, you'll need to [sign up for New Relic](https://newrelic.com/signup).
